\title{Solution to Linear System of Equations}
\author{Wenhao Zhang}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

Practical solutions to linear equations are described with a focus on 
iterative methods. The content mainly follow the book \emph{Numerical Mathematics} by 
Alfio Quarteroni, Riccardo Sacco and Fausto Saleri, chapter 3 and 4, but only the 
basics are introduced here. Another useful reference is \emph{Iterative Methods for Linear and Nonlinear Equations}
by C.T.Kelley. In Kelley's book, chapter 1 gives a short and useful review of the basic 
concepts. Furthermore, detailed algorithms are also provided that are suitable for 
applications, such as for conjugate gradient method.
