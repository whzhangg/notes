# Bonding in Coordination complexes
The fact that three of the five d-orbitals have their electron clouds directed between the cartesian axis while the other two are directed along the cartesian axes is a key point in understanding the bonding theory of metal complexs. The d-orbitals are shown in the following figures

### Crystal Field Theory
A simple approach to the bonding in metal complexes are the crystal field theory. It’s main features are:
- electrostatic model, only the electric field, created by electrons on the ligands, around the metal centre are considered
- Ligands are simply point charges and there are no metal-ligand covalent interactions

##### Octahedral Crystal Field
The 6 ligands are placed on the cartesian axes at the vertices of the octahedron and each ligand are treated as a negative point charge. 

If we consider the ligand charge has spherical symmetry, then the energy of the d-orbial will be pushed up, compared to the isolated ion because of the general repulsion between the d-orbital electrons and the negative charges on the ligands

When the ligand charge has octahedral symmetry, the degenerate d-orbital split into two part: the higher orbitals have $e_g$ symmetry and the lower energy ones are denoted as $t_{2g}$. The energy separation between them is usually denoted as $\Delta_{oct}$  or 10Dq. The two orbitals in $e_g$ set are raised by 0.6 $\Delta_{oct}$  and the other three orbitals are lowered by 0.4 $\Delta_{oct}$

The magnitude of the $\Delta_{oct}$  is determined by the strength of the crystal field, depending on the metal centre and the ligands. Two extremes are called “weak field” and “strong field”

##### Crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE)

Crystal field stabilization energy can be calculated from the splitting energy $\Delta_{oct}$  and the electronic configuration. 

For a high-spin configuration $d^4$, we have: CFSE = -0.6 $\Delta_{oct}$  and for low-spin configuration, we have: CFSE = -1.6 $\Delta_{oct}$ . The energy difference should be compared with the exchange energy which favor parallel spin configuration. Therefore, we have the relationship:
- For high spin: $\Delta_{oct}  > P$
- For low spin: $\Delta_{oct}  < P$

Where P is the energy cost of spin pairing. Therefore, in stong field, low spin configuration is favored energtically, while in weak field, high spin configuration is favored.

##### Tetrahedral Crystal Field
$d_{xy}$, $d_{yz}$ and $d_{xz}$ are closer to the ligands than other two d-orbitals. Therefore, for a regular tetrahedron, the splitting of the energy levels are reversed. 
- The higher energy orbitals are denoted $t_2$ orbital and the lower energy orbitals are $e$ orbital ( subscript g indicate inversion, which does not exist for tetrahedral coordination)
- The energy of the spitting is weaker compared to octahedral configuration, Therefore, tetrahedral complexes are almost always in high-spin configuration. Roughly $\Delta_{tet} \approx \frac{4}{9}\Delta_{oct}$

##### Other Crystal Field Splitting
The following figure summarize the common crystal fields, given with respect to $\Delta_{oct}$

### Jahn-Teller Distortion
##### Jahn-Teller Theorem
>Any non-linear molecular system in a degenerate electronic state will be unstable and will undergo distortion to form a system of lower symmetry and lower energy, thereby removing the degeneracy.

##### Distortion in octahedral complexes
Octahedral complexes are often distorted. Considered the case of high-spin $d^4$ ions, for undistorted structure, a single electron occupy the doubly degenerate $e_g$ level. Two distortion could occur:

In this figure:
1. If  the singly occpied orbital is $d_{z^2}$, then an elongation of the z-axes can reduce the electronic repulsion associated with these ligands and decrease the energy of the $d_{z^2}$orbitals
2. If the singly occupied orbital is $d_{x^2 - y^2}$, then an elongation of the x and y axes will lead to a stabilization of structure.

The following figure shows the lowering of the $d_{z^2}$ as the z-axe is enlongated:

### Ligand Field Theory
Ligand field theory is an extension of the crystal field theory which is freely parameterized to take into account situations that is not purely electrostatic. It is parameterized using $\Delta_{oct}$ and Racah parameters.


### Molecular orbital theory
Molecular orbital model considers covalent interaction between the metal centre and the ligands. Orbitals from the ligands are linearly combined according to symmetry and are hybirdized with the corresponding orbitals from the metal centre.

Both $\sigma$-bonds and $\pi$-bonds are possible to bond with the metal centre and the resulting energies levels are different.
