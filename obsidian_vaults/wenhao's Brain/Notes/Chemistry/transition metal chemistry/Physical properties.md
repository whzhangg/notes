### Optical absorption selection rule
Electronic energy levels are labelled with term symbols. Electronic transitions between different energy levels obey the following selection rules:
##### Spin selection rule $\Delta S = 0$
Transitions may occur from singlet to singlet, or front triplet to triplet states. But a change in spin multiplicity is forbidden
    
##### Laporte selection rule: there must be change in parity
For example, $g\to u$ is an allowed transition but $g \to g$ , $u \to u$ are forbidden transitions. The selection rule is therefore $\Delta l = \pm 1$ and the allowed transitions are $s\to p; p \to d; d\to f$. The forbidden transitions are $s\to s; p\to p; d\to d; f\to f; s\to d; p \to f$  etc.
    
The forbidden transitions becomes allowed if the symmetry is broken. For example, a lattice vibration that remove the inversion of the octahedral complex can mix $p$ and $d$ orbitals and transition from $d$ to $d$ orbitals mixed with a bit of $p$ can be allowed. Since the lifetime of lattice vibration is longer than the time for an electronic transition. But in these case, the absorption is relatively weak

### General magnetic properties
The magnetic moment here applies for the local moment on the transition metal centre for a metal complex
##### Spin only formula
Using $n$ for the number of unpaired electrons, the total spin quantum number S = n/2 and the spin magnetic moment can be expressed as:
$$\mu(spin\ only) = 2\sqrt{S(S+1)}$$

##### Orbital contribution to the magnetic moment
Van Vleck formula can be used to take into account of the orbital part of the angular momentum:
$$\mu_{eff} = \sqrt{4S(S+1)+L(L+1)}$$

##### Spin orbital coupling 
In determining the momentum. The equation for the effective momentum can be given as:
$$\mu_{eff} = \mu(spin\ only)(1 - \frac{\alpha \lambda}{\Delta_{oct}})$$

where $\alpha$ is 4 for A ground state and 2 for E ground state. $\lambda$ is the spin orbital coupling coefficient and its values are tabulated for each transition metals. This expression make correction for the energy of the configurations.
