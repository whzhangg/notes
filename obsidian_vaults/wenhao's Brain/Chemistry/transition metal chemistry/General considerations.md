### General considerations
##### General
- d-block metals are sometimes called transition metals. However, the group 12 metals (Zn, Cd and Hg) are not always classified as transition metals.
- Each group in the d-block metals consists of three members, called **triad**
- metals of the second and third rows in the d-block are called **heavier d-block metals**
- $M^{2+}$ and $M^{3+}$ ions of the first row of the d-block all have electronic configuration of the form $[Ar]3d^n$ and the chemistry of these metals are mainly concerned with the successive filling of the $3d$ orbitals

##### Properties of the First row d-block metals
Compared to the heavier d-block metals, the ones in the first row:
- Electronic absorption and magnetic properties of the first row can often be described by crystal or ligand field theory. For heavier elements, spin-orbital coupling is more important
- Metal-metal bonding is more important for the heavier metals than for the ones in the first row

The following table gather some important properties for the first row metals. common oxidation states are included, [ ] incidate rare oxidation state

##### Common coordination
High coordination numbers are most likely to be attained with small ligands and large metal ions. Size of metal ion decrease as formal charge increase and in general decrease from left to right in the periodic table.
