>There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the foundamental question of philosophy. 

This is the most urgent question because of the action it entails: Death. Especially, we are concerned here between individual thoughts and suicide. Suicide amounts to confessing: dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized the ridiculous character, and the absence of any profound reason in living, and the uselessness of suffering. If we recognize these points, naturally, we have a long for death. 

But man have a natural will to live: there is something stronger than all the ills in the word. Then what should be that motivation? 

##### Absurd wall

Absurdity surround us. Our daily life is mechanical and weariness comes at the end of the day. It brings a monent of consciousness and provokes us to think about if they have any meaning. We long for tomorrow, but this implies that we understand the passage of time and an end, whose horror seize us.  "He is long for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it." This horror comes from the mathematical aspect of death. There are no code of ethics and no effort are justifiable in the face of the curel mathematics that command our condition. Our death is absurd. 

The external world are absurd as well: at the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman: nature and landscapes *negate* us. We are a mere stranger and this external world leaves us along. Man also secrete inhuman: other man feels mechnical *you wonder why he is alive*. This "discomfort" in the face of man's own inhumanity is absurd. 

The human intellegience is also absurd. 

Our mind's deepest desire is an insistence upon familiarity, an appetite for clarity. A man can only be satisfied when he obtain a clear vision and understand reality and unity. However, there is a gap between what we fancy we know and what we really know. Often we live in our ideas and rejecting the truth that would "upset our whole life" so *today people despair of true knowledge*. Furthermore, our feelings we cannot grasp: they are like water slipping thought my fingers when we try to define and to summarize them. Thus "the very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to me". Therefore, forever I should be a stranger to myself. 

We can also not understand our world within science, what we can never see we can never know, and if science build everything in the end upon a hypothesis. Science teaches me but it is not sure, thus all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine. Therefore, intelligence too tells me that this world is absurd. 
>A stranger to myself and to the world, armed solely with a thought that negates itself as soon as it asserts... To will is to stir up paradoxes. Everything is ordered in such a way as to bring into being that poisoned pease produced by thoughtlessness, lack of heart and fatal renunciations. The world is not reasonable, that is all that can be said.

>At this point of his effort man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.
