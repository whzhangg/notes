##### Introduction

>There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the foundamental question of philosophy. 

This is the most urgent question because of the action it entails: Death. Especially, we are concerned here between individual thoughts and suicide. Suicide amounts to confessing: dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized the ridiculous character, and the absence of any profound reason in living, and the uselessness of suffering. If we recognize these points, naturally, we have a long for death. 

But man have a natural will to live: there is something stronger than all the ills in the word. Then what should be that motivation? 

##### Absurd wall
Absurdity surround us. Our daily life is mechanical and weariness comes at the end of the day. It brings a monent of consciousness and provokes us to think about if they have any meaning. We long for tomorrow, but this implies that we understand the passage of time and an end, whose horror seize us.  "He is long for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it." This horror comes from the mathematical aspect of death. There are no code of ethics and no effort are justifiable in the face of the curel mathematics that command our condition. Our death is absurd. 

The external world are absurd as well: at the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman: nature and landscapes *negate* us. We are a mere stranger and this external world leaves us along. Man also secrete inhuman: other man feels mechnical *you wonder why he is alive*. This "discomfort" in the face of man's own inhumanity is absurd. 

The human intellegience is also absurd. 

Our mind's deepest desire is an insistence upon familiarity, an appetite for clarity. A man can only be satisfied when he obtain a clear vision and understand reality and unity. However, there is a gap between what we fancy we know and what we really know. Often we live in our ideas and rejecting the truth that would "upset our whole life" so *today people despair of true knowledge*. Furthermore, our feelings we cannot grasp: they are like water slipping thought my fingers when we try to define and to summarize them. Thus "the very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to me". Therefore, forever I should be a stranger to myself. 

We can also not understand our world within science, what we can never see we can never know, and if science build everything in the end upon a hypothesis. Science teaches me but it is not sure, thus all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine. Therefore, intelligence too tells me that this world is absurd. 
>A stranger to myself and to the world, armed solely with a thought that negates itself as soon as it asserts... To will is to stir up paradoxes. Everything is ordered in such a way as to bring into being that poisoned pease produced by thoughtlessness, lack of heart and fatal renunciations. The world is not reasonable, that is all that can be said.
>...
>At this point of his effort man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.

##### Philosophical Suicide
Camus in this section criticized the *escape* from absurdity for existential philosophies. Again, it need to be stressed that absurdity arise from the disproportion between man's intention and the reality he sure will encounter, so that "absurdity is not in man nor in the world, but in their presence together". Absurdity in life means a confrontation and a struggle that is a "total absence of hope", a "continual rejection" and a "conscious dissatisfaction". 

On the other hand, we wish to preserve "the very thing that crushes me", we need to straightly face this disproportion between man and world, preserve our will and desire for unity and clarity (man is always a prey to his truths, once he admitted them, he cannot free himself from them) as well as what we experience from reality, Because "everything that destroys, conjures away or exocrises these requirements ruins the absurd and devaluates the attitude that may then be proposed". 

Camus first mentioned existential philosophies. All of them, accord to Camus, suggest escape by making "absurd" into "God" and everything that we cannot understood into the "existance that illuminates everything". As Jasper said "Does not the failure reveal, beyong any possible explanation and interpretation, not the absence but the existence of transcendence?". Camus commented that this is a "humiliating thought". Camus said that "I want to know whether I can live with what I know and with that alone", and he want to remain in a "middle path" where intelligence can remain clear because "that is its pride". 

Therefore, the existential philosophies is life "philosophical suicide" where the "thought negates itself and tends to transcend itself in its very negation." Camus also mentioned phenomenologists such as Husserl and their ideas, which declines to explain the world but only admit a description of actual experience. The thoughts of existentialism and phenomenologism either negate reason or negate reality, both of them suggest escape throught negating one end of the absurdity. But "we cannot suppress absurd by denying one of the terms of its equation". For an absurd mind, the world is neither so rational nor so irrational, it is unreasonable and only that. The important feature distinguishing absurdity is that "absurd is lucid reason noting its limits" In absurd mind, it is this contradiction that "binds" what mind desire the world that disappoint together, since Camus is interested not in philosophical suicide, but in plain suicide.

##### Absurd Freedom
>What I believe to be true I must therefore preserve. What seems to me so obvious, even against me, I must support. 

Here the author discussed how to find a meaning of life when "we can understand only in human terms":
>Man enters in with his revolt and his lucidity, he has forgotten how to hope. This hell of the present is his Kingdom at last. ... Is one going to die, escape by the "leap", or is one going to *take up the heart-rending and marvelous wager of the absurd?*

Camus suggests that "living is keeping the absurd alive, and comtemplating it" so that we cannot turn away from it, and the only position for us is therefore to *revolt*. Suicide is the acceptance at its extreme, it settles the absurd. On the contrary, revolt give life its value. Spread out over the whole length of a life and restore its majesty.

Freedom can be found by accepting the absord. Before encountering the absurd. Everyday man live within the concern for absurd tomorrow. He counts on "someday" but in truth, he only acts as he were free. But aftering realizing the absurdity of possible death, the man realized that he can never be free and there is no future. *Henceforth this is the reason for my inner freedom*. The return to consciousness and the escape to everyday "sleep" represent a step to absurd freedom. 

>Absurd man thus catches sight of a burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in which nothing is possible but everything is given, and beyong which all is collapse and nothingless. He can then decide to accept such a university and draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope and the unyielding evidence of a life without consolation. 

In such a unvierse, freedom has no meaning except in relatinship to its limitted fate, and therefore a man's rule of conduct has no meaning except through the quantity and variety of experience he has been in a position to accumulate. *Being aware of one's life, one's revolt and one's freedom, and to maximum, is living to the maximum*. This is the *passion* we should have in our lifes.

##### Myth of Sisyphus
Camus commented on Sisyphus: the workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd. But is is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. 
>Sisyphus, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extend of his wretched condition: It is what he thinks of during his descent of the mountain. The lucidity that was to consistute his torture at the same time crowns his victory. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted (conqured) by scorn.
>
>The absurd man, when he contemplated his torment, silences all the idols. ... If there is a personal fate, there is no higher destiny, or at least there is, but one which he concludes is inevitable and despicable. For the rest, he knows himeself to be the master of his days. At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he comteplates that serious of unrelated actions which become his fate, created by him, combined under his memory's eye and soon sealed by his death. 
>
>One always find one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. *The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart*. One must imagine Sisyhus happy
