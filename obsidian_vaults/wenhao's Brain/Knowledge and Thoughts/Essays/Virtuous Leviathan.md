# Creating a Virtuous Leviathan
Delia Lin and Susan Trevaskes, *Creating a Virtuous Leviathan: The Party, Law and Socialist Core Values*, Asian Journal of Law and Society, 2019, 6, 41-66
### Summary
The author draw a direct line between confusian moral law system and the current "governing the nation by morality" idea in China, arguing that it provide a legal foundation the Leviathan-like authoritrian leadership. 
### Pan-moralism
In western legal theory , the central issue in the relationship between law and morality is whether law and morality are conceptually distinct or inextricably interwined. Both view also occur in accient China. Han Fei Zi are the founder of the legalist system, who argue that law is separate from morality and is a system of rules in order to regulate human behavior, since human actions are driven by self-interest. On the other hand, the confucian notion stress the *universal moral system* which is the key for governance and maintenance of social order. In the confucian ideal, the author stated, the ruler is constructed as a saintly moral figure who is considered as the national's moral teacher. *Following this logic, the author stated that in confucian system, political legitmacy and moral authority are two sides of the same coin*. The confucian system dominate chinese social thinking for a long time since Han dynasty and continued all the way to the revolution in 1900s and is very resilient. 

The author gave some arguments against such "confucian moral law system":
1. One of the most import defect of this legal system is its tendency towards "pan-moralism", meaning that the law itself is subordinate to particular circumstances under which a crime is committed, epecially those based on kinship relationships. Pan-moralism means a certain "overwhelming" or exaggeration of the claim of the moral statepoint. 
2. Law become instrumental and judicial decision making process would be an "ever-expanding and ever-changing process of bargaining, negotiating and mediation... led to the absurd situation of a centralized but weak power structure on the one hand, and a people who have no respect for, yet are submissive to, the law"
3. Trying to *promote moral principles* through law would results in a law without authority and one's freedom to act as an autonomous and rational moral agent. 

In the case of China, asserting harmony between law and morality enable the party leaders to promote the thinking that binds together the notion of "governing the nation by morality" and "goverening the nation by law" and enable them to directly incorporate their "core values" into the legal realm, permitting the party's moral authority to rule above the law. 

>As in the Confucian–Legalist imperial state, morality here is treated in a particular normative sense whereby claims are made about the unified nature of socialist values held by China’s rulers and the ruled. No regard is given to any alternative reality that might operate in a diverse and heterogeneous society characterized by complex moral values. In other words, morality becomes an ideology that demands not mere compliance, but complete unity of thinking between the Party and the people it governs.
>...,
>The integration of party's moral values into law is consistent with the vision of establishing the absolute power and authority of the party, ..., This is the rationale by means of which autonomous moral agency and pluralistic individual judgement relating to the social and political lives of the people must be renounced. When the power of the Party is absolute and its judgement without fault, the will of the individual is rendered obsolete.

### Virtuous Leviathan
[Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes) propsed the *Leviathan thesis* (1651). In Hobbes' theory, civil peace and social unity can only be achieved creating a Common Power, by all citizens surrender their will to *a great Leviathan*, a leader who, by means of centralized power and strength, perform the will of all the people for peace and common security. 

The author argue that a close comparison esixt between the Leviathan idea and the worldview of authoritarian government that power need to be centralized. However, in Hobbesian's theory, the people surrender their free will in exchange for the promise of a safer existence for all and there are Hobbes' view is a liberal view of social contract. But in the regime of china, the *pan-moralism* stance *enable the moral authority to define its own political legitimacy* and allows the party to declare unity with its people and merge more completely with the state. This is the essence of the current "rule of law by moral virtue" phenomenon
