# The Doctrine of Fascism
Benito Mussolini 1032

### General Throughts of Fascism
>Fascism is action and thought, action in which doctrine is immanent. 

Therefore, fascism is therefore a thought of how to see the world. It mainly includes the attitude of man towards life as well as towards the state. 
##### Attitude towards life
The doctrine rejects the enlightenment thinking that a man appear as an individual, standing by himself, self-centered and subject to natural law, which "instinctively urges him toward a life of selfish momentary pleasure". Rather, Fasicm believe in the notion of a "higher life, found on duty" and that life of man is a struggle in which it behooves a man to win for himself a really worthy place. Man must be active and to engage in action with all his duty, his difficult awith all his energies. Therefore, Fasicm believe life is "serious, asutere and religious" and disdains an esay life.

Fascism believe that life is a struggle and "struggle is at the origin of all things". Fascism do not believe that peace is possible with people unit as a universal brotherhood. Life in Fascism is therefore a continuous, ceaseless fight.
>We do not believe in program, in plans, in saints, above all we believe not in happiness, in savlation, in the promised land..., We are men, living men, who wish to gave our contribution, however modest, to the creation of history.
>
>I believe that if a people wish to live, they should develop a will to power, otherwise they vegetate, live miserably and become prey to a stronger people.

##### Anti-individualistic character.
Fasicm believe that man is man only by virture of the spiritual process to which he contribute as a member of his family, the social group and the nation. Outside history man is a nonentity and therefore Fasicm is directly opposed to all individualistic abstractions. Fascist conception of life also stress the importance of the state and accept individual only in so far as his interests coincide with those of the state, which stands for the conscience and the universal will of man. Outside the state no human existance have value. Therefore, Fascism is totalitarian.
The state need to be progressive, Inactive state is a dead state, therefore states need organization and expansion. 

### Political and Social Doctrine
##### Creation of Fascism 
Fascism born of the need of action.our of the need for the direct representation of the several interests. *We must rush forward, the the present regime is to be superseded we must take its place... for we urged the country to enter the war and we led it to victory...*. Therefore, Fascism is born as a faith, even though in the beginning it is not a complete doctirine. 

##### Attitude towards war and heroism
Fascism do not believe in the possibility of utility of perpetual peace. It believes that "War along keys up all human energies to their maximum tensor and sets the seal for nobility on those people who have the courage to face it". Fascism signifies a fighting spirit which accepts all risks and require that "as a member of the community of nations it looks other peoples straight in the eyes, vigilant and on guard", that Fascism has nothing to do with universial embraces. Fascism do not accept the scientific or Marxian socialism, which explain history in terms of class struggle and exclude all else. Fascism believes in sanctity and heroism. 
Fascism also rejects socialism in which the suffering of the humbler folks would be relieved by economic redistribution. Fascism denies the materialistic conception of happiness as a possibility and denies the equation: well-being == happiness, which "sees in mem mere animals, content when they can feed and fatten".

##### Attitude towards democracy
Fascism rejects democratic ideologies both in terms of their premise and their practical application and implements. It denies that numbers can be the determining factor in human society and consider Democracy as a "kingless regime" infested by many kings that we more destructive than one. In rejecting democracy, fascism rejects the idea of political equilitarianism and the habit of collective irresponsibility. 
Fascism is absolutely opposed to the doctrines of liberalism, both in the political and the economic sphere. It consider liberalism an old idea and is going to be deserted by the peoples. "We are free to believe that this is the century of authority", and the source of objective of man is "its will to power, its will to live, its attitude toward violence and its value"

##### The concept of states
The key of fascism is its conception of the State. For fascism the state is absolute, its widely awake and has a will of its own. It guarantees the internal and external security of the people and their spirit. The states eduate the citizens, make them aware of their mission and harmonize their divergent interests. Fascism desires the state to be strong and organic, based on popular support. Once the state base it authority, its action on the will of millions of individuals who recognize its authority, it is then not a tyrannical state. 

##### Religion
Fascism sees in religion one of the deepest spiritual manifestations and it respects religion and also defend it and protects it. Fascist nation is an imperial nation and sees the imperial spirit as a manifestation of their vitality. People who rise or rearise are imperialistic, surrender is a character of dying peoples. Fascism consider imperialism to imply discipline, the coordination of efforts and a deep sense of duty and self-sacrifice.
It is belived that "never before have the peoples thirsted for authority, direction, order, as they do now" and the doctrine of our age is fascism. 

##### Towards freedom
Fascism believe that freedom is not a right, but a duty. It is not a gift, but a conquest, it is not equality, but a privilege. In a Fascism state, the individual is not deprived of freedom. But he gain greater freedom under the protection of the state.
