The main theme in these sessions are about distributive politics in the western countries

### The Resurgent Right in the West
##### Shift to the right with Regean and Thatcher
Post war consensus: social democracy, creation of media care and walfare state
- stronge welfare and protections
- large redistributions
- substantially bipartisan

Later conservative(neoliberalism) attack, Ronald Regean (1970) and Friedman advocate neoliberalism around 1960s
- against union
- against large redistribution
- "government is the problem"!

There is an imergance of conservative and right wing politican. Its sources are mainly: 
1. collapse of communism
1. the logic of distributive politices
2. power relations in the economy

Collapse of communism: 
*power does not shift back to the left*. many of the factor favor left dimenish as the cold war ended, such as demography and population change. Alternative bogeyman such as terrorism and support from capitalists at the same time. (Welfare is capitalists best friend because it suppress the discontent of the working class)

distributive politics:
Median income always below the mean because rich peaple pull up the average. Politicans want to win the median income voters, instead of the average income. Median voter theorem: politican want to win the support of the median or low income voter by distributing downwards. But this exception in fact not happen, because there are more dimenison in politics than just economy motivates, such as race, women's rights. Therefore, the left does not necessary win with redistribution policies.
Major rule divide a dollar game: major rule create instability, economy interest along does not produce effective demand for downward redistribution. The interest itself will not be sufficient to sustain a particular distribution. 

##### Solidarity on the left and fairness
To sustain the redistrubtion for the left, ideals about what is fair become important for solidarity on the left. But it is complicated. What can be considered to be fair and acceptable in turns of economy development? It is therefore a question between the *relative concept of fairness*, which are a cause for redistribution and the *absolute improvement based concept* which is economy growth argument. In general, studies people make relatively local comparsion in their social order.

Reagon and Thatcher's focus in this argument is the absolute improvement improvment and prospects for upward mobility. It is much harder to hold the solidarity based coalition on the left if you can break apart the coalition. Anyway, it is harder to sustain redistributive policy on the left, even though it benefit to the average worker (progressive change instead of regressive change). 

##### Insistution components for Solidarity
Insistutions component to create solidarity: Unions? Union membership continue to decrease and as unions get smaller and smaller, inequality increase.

Inequalities has decreased during the social democratic movement during the post war period but increase with the resurgence on the right after the cold war, especially in two party systems. Multi-party systems are supposed to be more reactive to the median voters.


### Reorienting the Left
>Right of trade union decrease, entrepreneur rise, we will see many victim of market forces. She measure the price of everything, but value in nothing. Thatcher's market policy remove the best part of us and only the bad remain.
>Tony Ben

New Left: New labour in Britain, Tony Blair, 1995 as well as new democrats, Bill clinton
##### Psychology of distributive politics
- Absolute gains: am I better off than I was
- Relative gains: am I better off than the others
Most economy theory considers absolute gain in most cases, because with absolute gain, there can be win-win, but with relative gain, one only side can win. Relative gains are more potent in politics, but local referrence groups matter more than distant ones.

thought experiment: Steve is told he has won the lottery and the prize is $2m. The next day he is told a second ticket is found and thus has only won $1m. Art is told he has one of two winning tickets and will win $500k. The next day he learns there was no second winner and he has won $1m. Both of them won $1m doller, but who is happier? Steve somehow thnk he lost something. 
If you have something taken away from you, it bothers you more than you be happy when you gain equivalently in someway.

##### left of center parties and median voters
Clinton's new democrates moved to the center. [Politics of triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(politics)). But as Clinton move to the center, the exterme side of your party is no longer satisfied. But the solidarity is no longer there to bond the whole left. 

*As a result, Fragmentation of the left occur*. Fragmentation of the left parties: the number of parties on the left increase dramatically. But the right does not fragment as much. This make solidaristic ideologies among voters more difficult to sustain and a decline the central left party
Proliferation of far right parties is not surprising, driven by the shifting of left parties to the center

Distributive politics in two party & multi-party system
Multiparty system:
- more representative (but may not be more representative at a governing stage

##### Unions
Unions as insitutions that reinforce solidaristic ideals for below median voters. are becoming less effective and weaker. On the other hand, if the union are strong power in poltical parties, union is going to pull the power from the Government, because union is for the benefit of its members only. 

But unions are also decreasing in these systems. Two implications:
1. left-of-center parties will be less effective in protecting employed workers. 
2. Protecting unionized workers may impose costs on others below the median income.
