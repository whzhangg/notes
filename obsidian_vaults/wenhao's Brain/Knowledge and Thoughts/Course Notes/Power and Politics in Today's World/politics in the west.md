The main theme in these sessions are about distributive politics in the western countries

### The Resurgent Right in the West
##### Shift to the right with Regean and Thatcher
Post war consensus: social democracy, creation of media care and walfare state
- stronge welfare and protections
- large redistributions
- substantially bipartisan

Later conservative(neoliberalism) attack, Ronald Regean (1970) and Friedman advocate neoliberalism around 1960s
- against union
- against large redistribution
- "government is the problem"!

There is an imergance of conservative and right wing politican. Its sources are mainly: 
1. collapse of communism
1. the logic of distributive politices
2. power relations in the economy

Collapse of communism: 
*power does not shift back to the left*. many of the factor favor left dimenish as the cold war ended, such as demography and population change. Alternative bogeyman such as terrorism and support from capitalists at the same time. (Welfare is capitalists best friend because it suppress the discontent of the working class)

distributive politics:
Median income always below the mean because rich peaple pull up the average. Politicans want to win the median income voters, instead of the average income. Median voter theorem: politican want to win the support of the median or low income voter by distributing downwards. But this exception in fact not happen, because there are more dimenison in politics than just economy motivates, such as race, women's rights. Therefore, the left does not necessary win with redistribution policies.
Major rule divide a dollar game: major rule create instability, economy interest along does not produce effective demand for downward redistribution. The interest itself will not be sufficient to sustain a particular distribution. 

##### Solidarity on the left and fairness
To sustain the redistrubtion for the left, ideals about what is fair become important for solidarity on the left. But it is complicated. What can be considered to be fair and acceptable in turns of economy development? It is therefore a question between the *relative concept of fairness*, which are a cause for redistribution and the *absolute improvement based concept* which is economy growth argument. In general, studies people make relatively local comparsion in their social order.

Reagon and Thatcher's focus in this argument is the absolute improvement improvment and prospects for upward mobility. It is much harder to hold the solidarity based coalition on the left if you can break apart the coalition. Anyway, it is harder to sustain redistributive policy on the left, even though it benefit to the average worker (progressive change instead of regressive change). 

##### Insistution components for Solidarity
Insistutions component to create solidarity: Unions? Union membership continue to decrease and as unions get smaller and smaller, inequality increase. 
![[inequality.png|500]]
Inequalities has decreased during the social democratic movement during the post war period but increase with the resurgence on the right after the cold war, especially in two party systems. Multi-party systems are supposed to be more reactive to the median voters.


### Reorienting the Left
>Right of trade union decrease, entrepreneur rise, we will see many victim of market forces. She measure the price of everything, but value in nothing. Thatcher's market policy remove the best part of us and only the bad remain.
>Tony Ben

New Left: New labour in Britain, Tony Blair, 1995 as well as new democrats, Bill clinton
##### Psychology of distributive politics
- Absolute gains: am I better off than I was
- Relative gains: am I better off than the others
Most economy theory considers absolute gain in most cases, because with absolute gain, there can be win-win, but with relative gain, one only side can win. Relative gains are more potent in politics, but local referrence groups matter more than distant ones.

thought experiment: Steve is told he has won the lottery and the prize is $2m. The next day he is told a second ticket is found and thus has only won $1m. Art is told he has one of two winning tickets and will win $500k. The next day he learns there was no second winner and he has won $1m. Both of them won $1m doller, but who is happier? Steve somehow thnk he lost something. 
If you have something taken away from you, it bothers you more than you be happy when you gain equivalently in someway.

##### left of center parties and median voters
Clinton's new democrates moved to the center. [Politics of triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(politics)). But as Clinton move to the center, the exterme side of your party is no longer satisfied. But the solidarity is no longer there to bond the whole left. 

*As a result, Fragmentation of the left occur*. Fragmentation of the left parties: the number of parties on the left increase dramatically. But the right does not fragment as much. This make solidaristic ideologies among voters more difficult to sustain and a decline the central left party
Proliferation of far right parties is not surprising, driven by the shifting of left parties to the center

Distributive politics in two party & multi-party system
Multiparty system:
- more representative (but may not be more representative at a governing stage

##### Unions
Unions as insitutions that reinforce solidaristic ideals for below median voters. are becoming less effective and weaker. On the other hand, if the union are strong power in poltical parties, union is going to pull the power from the Government, because union is for the benefit of its members only. 

But unions are also decreasing in these systems. Two implications:
1. left-of-center parties will be less effective in protecting employed workers. 
2. Protecting unionized workers may impose costs on others below the median income. 

### Shifting Goalposts: The Anti-Tax Movement
anti-tax movement and civil right movement transforms our society significantly
##### Anti-tax movement
Origin: 
1. post-watergate republicans invest in activist think tank on the right to re-think the policy for the median right: small government, shrinking welfare state. 
2. California's proposition 13 (1978): huge tax cut for california residence. "Government is the problem"

##### Referendum Politics
Brexit paradox: both political party are overwhelming pro-remain but the referendum result are opposite. In a political vote, many issues are bundled, but in a referendum with one issue, the result is more straightforward. The key point is that in a compound issue, preferences are "discounted" by other consequences. Therefore, single issue voting encourage choosing things without considering the cost. 
How to frame an issue is important. Tax cuts is described as a *single issue politics*

##### Estate Tax Repeal
George W Bush abolish the estate tax, 2000 and shrink the size of the government. A coalition is constructured who support it or at least don't against it. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Growth_and_Tax_Relief_Reconciliation_Act_of_2001

##### Republican coalition
Effect of Tax cuts
1. Tax cuts is the one issue that unite the entire republican party. 
2. Tax cut and race issue: The tax cutting agenda is linked to the racial agenda
3. Prevent the divide dollar game: anybody got a benefit

How effect is the shrink of government? Tax cut does not decrease the government spending in republican government, only increased public debt. Tax cut movement transfer the funding of government through tax to funding the government through debt

### Privatizing Government I
eminent domain
##### Privatization
1990s, Post-Communist Privatization: creating a private economy, especially in communist countries.
1980s, Neo-liberal privatizations: 
1. privatizing previously nationalized companies like railway or mail system, utilities and local governments.
2. Privation of public authority: Eminent domain, lobbyist writting
3. Core government function: militrary, prison

![[mapping varieties of privatization.png|500]]

Neoliberism at home and Washington concensus aboard. 
main components: deregulation, privatization and free trade. They are hegemonic before 2008, after which starts to break. After 2008, significant amount of regulation become in place, but privatization process remain. Free trade is still populate until 2016. 

One of the backlash of privatization is the privatization of natural resources (Water in Bolivia 1999-2000)
>The people of Bolivia did not choose to privatize their public water systems.That choice was forced on them, as it has been in many poor nations around the world, when the World Bank made privatization an explicit condition of aid in the mid-1990s.Poor countries such as Bolivia, which rely heavily on foreign assistance for survival, are not in much of a position to say no to such pressures.
>
>World Bank water officials claim all the best intentions when they make the push for water privatization.The bank has argued that poor governments are often too plagued by local corruption and too ill equipped to run public water systems efficiently. Handing water over to foreign corporations, the bank has said, opens the door to needed investment and skilled management.
>source: https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/politics-water-bolivia/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization_in_Bolivia

The Bolivia government backdown and renationalized 

##### Eminent Domain
The right of the government to take a private properties for common good. For example, privatization using government power, India amendment to land acquistion act of 1894, 2007 and 70% rule: If a private developer can buy up 70% of the land, then the local government will accquire the rest 30% and sell it to the companies. Initially, government use eminent power to build special economy zone. Tata Nano in Singur, West Bengal. 
In the case of Bolivia and Bengal, Eminent Domain privatization backfire and destabilize the current government.

Privatizing eminent domain in US: Taking Clause, 5th Amendment: ...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

What is a public use? Economist public good: 1) not excludable, if you provide it, everybody will get benefit from it. 2) non-rivialrous: my having it does not stop you from using it. But it still going to be politically charged. For example, building a road is a public good, but there are always alternative courses of action, more than one way to provide it so there will be winners and losers. Secondly, even if on net, the public good is desirable, it will still have externalities. Finally, the problem of value derivation, for example, the price of land and its value. [Kelo vs the city of new london](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London) where the private own opposed the transfer of land to the New London Development Corporation.

Upshots of eminent domain: neither efficiency or just compensation might suffice to ease privatization, as well as externalities effective opposition. 

There is no technique answer to the question, it is a political question and project

##### Privatizing local government
Tax cut movement reduce local government revenue, One way the local government response is privatizing "Common interest development", for example, garbage pickup, local police. 

What are the consequences?
- Undemoractic board
- Effects on homelessness and poor, people who cannot play will not be served
- segmented democracy with privatized common interest development and people become more extreme and polarization
- They are here to stay

### Privatization of Core Government functions: Prison and Military
Things have to do with people's servival
slim down of the government by removing functions that government don't do very well: From 1980s Reagon to 2000s, Including out-sourcing in the military (contracting)

##### Privatization of military
![[us military contractors.png]]
What are the private military contract with the following functions. A example [BlackWater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater_(company))
- not frontline fighting
- routine security and heavily armed security, mine clearance and intelligence
- security of key officials

Using the contractor reduce the political cost related to casualities in war. Consequences: It save momey and gain potential efficiency, it also enable US to fight otherwise unpopular wars, Is it a good thing?
- It provide incentive to find new wars (Republican theory of US in Federalist papers)
- [Democratic peace theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory): Democracies tend not to find each other since it is difficult for people to support to find wars

##### Prisons
The numbers of americans in prison increase significantly: War on Drugs and Sentencing reform act are two factors that lead to the increase. But the violent crime has been declining overall, although most people don't feel that way. 

Private sector prison is flourishing (10%)
Assume they are more efficient, is there reason to against it? 

##### Problems
Core state function need to be a monopoly but the privatization of these functions is contracting out the government monopoly and these functionality cannot be fully private. Central challenge is a series of principal-agent problem: principle contract out to agent to do thing but it become the problem that the agent have more information than the principle to deal with the situation. 
Monitoring chain: voter -> politican -> regulator -> contractor

Solution to principal-agent problem: 
- competitions (but these functionality has huge cost for entry and thus less competition)
- alignment of interests (but as in the case of prison industry, the interest does not align, and therefore lobbying problem)
- monitoring (but is difficult)

### Money in Politics
[Citizen united](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC)
##### Courts in american politics
The Warren court is the most progressive (liberal) court.
##### The first amendment since Buckley v. Valeo
The supply side.
"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances"
How the court has interpreted it:
1974, changes to the federal election campaign to reduce the use of momey in election campaigns
1976, Buckley struct down most of the changes: it is OK to limit contributions, but not OK to limit expenditure (spending money to express views), it's not OK to limit a candidate to use their own money. The leveling the playing field is not OK because it is a interference. The self funded candidate can spend as much as he want as a consititution right. Implication: Money is speech, no interest to level the playing group.
1990, Austin v. Michigan: cooperations are not protected in the same way as individuals by the first amendment.
2010, Citizens United: the court overruled Austin by saying that the congress maynot limit independent corporate expenditures, assume that the first amendment rule corporation the same as individuals. Corporations have the same free speech rights as individuals
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_money
SuperPacs

The only corruption worth worrying about is "quid pro quo" and massive increase in inequality in contribution and influence in candidates. 

##### The changing media context
More channels for communting information, no reason to have fairness doctrine because there is no scarcity of channels. The political consequences is that the new channels are separated and segragated. It is difficult to have a channel where different thoughts and views are competed against each other (like for example in UK parliment). Now political action not about argument over policy but is about mobilizing the people who already support you which tend to make people more extreme. 

##### The demand for money in an era of weak parties
Why politicans need money: 
- frequent electrons & staggered cycles
- primaries and other features of weak parties

A weak party is very decentralized in its control, in UK for example, a strong party can appoint candidate and politicans try to win as a team. In US, the party is weak. The candidates are on their own and can influence the decision of the party. Therefore, in US the politics are very expensive because of the arm race in campaigning between different candidates and it is difficult to limit the rule of money in politics. But the arms race is difficult to stop once started.
