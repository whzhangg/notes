### Introduction of the Course
The collapse of Soviet communism ushered in an era of widespread confidence in capitalist prosperity and democracy. Francis Fukuyama’s declaration, in 1992, that a benign end of history had finally arrived garnered widespread attention across much of the developed and developing world. Confidence in this new order endured through the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and even the financial crisis of 2008, but then it began to falter. Anemic economic recoveries in the West, revived authoritarianism in Russia and other new democracies, military stalemates in Afghanistan and Iraq, and stillborn Arab spring revolutions after 2012 took their toll. 2016 was a watershed, marked most dramatically by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump’s populist stampede to the U.S. presidency, but also by the resurgence of extreme right- wing parties in many European countries the like of which had not been seen since the 1930s.

This course provides an examination of political dynamics and institutions over this tumultuous quarter century, and the implications of these changes for what comes next. Among the topics covered are the decline of trade unions and enlarged role of business as political forces, changing attitudes towards parties and other political institutions amidst the growth of inequality and middle-class insecurity, the emergence of new forms of authoritarianism, and the character and durability of the unipolar international order that replaced the Cold War.

Part I deals with the collapse of communism and its aftermath, both in former communist countries that adopted market-based economies and in the developed West where the absence of a competitor to capitalism recast relations among business, labor, and governments. Part II focuses on the early post-Cold War era, marked by the Washington Consensus on the benefits of free trade, privatization, and deregulation, and interventionist agendas to fight terrorism, prevent human rights abuses, and to spread democracy. In part III we turn to the backlash that set in after the financial crisis, as technocratic elites lost legitimacy, the global war on terror became mired in quagmires across the Middle East, and humanitarian intervention and democracy spreading agendas foundered. The new politics of insecurity is our subject in part IV, where we explore the sources of the populist explosions of 2016 and the politics to which they have given rise. This leads to a consideration of responses in part V, where we discuss the kinds of policies that are needed for a world in which congenital employment insecurity is going to be the norm, and the political reforms that would increase the chances of those policies being adopted.

### Part 1. THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM AND ITS AFTERMATH
##### From Soviet Communism to Russian Gangster Capitalism
This session focus on three main topics:
1. Why did the USSR collapse? 
2. Why was the collapse peaseful?
3. What did Russia transform to?

Why did the USSR collapse? The USSR model is unsustainable, nobody believed in its political ideas and there are corruption everywhere. The western [containment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment) also worked. Then, why was the collapse peaseful? Shapiro mentioned the work *Exit, Voice and Loyalty* by Albert O. Hirschman that there are three things you can do if the organization you belong are failing: leave, complain or fix it yourself. Royality and cost of these acts play an important role in the decision making. In the case of Russia, the royality is low and so is the cost of exit, therefore, exit is the naturl result. There are little royalty here because of the widespread evidence of brazen corruption. The political costs of exiting the current regime are also decreased at that time since political elites have the preparation to exit for some times. And russia has a weak state at that time to prevent exiting. 

At the begining of 21th century, Putin obtain power and become the leader of Russia. Putin adapted methods from capitalism to transform the state from a weak state to a stronger state, but only to serve his own interest. Russia is still inheritly corrupt. One important reason for Russia's corruption is its heavy dependence on a single industry, oil, that depend on natural resources.

##### A Unipolar World? NATO, the EU, & the Washington Consensus
Three lenses on Politics:
1. People's interest: realistic interest based decisions
2. Institutions: court, separation of power, institutional arrangement, may or may not align with people or countries' interest
3. Ideals: culture, norms that affect what actually happens in politics
To say which is the right one is the wrong question, we should focus on under which conditions which view is more important. 

Gulf War, 1991 Operation Desert storm. George Bush, the first international security crisis after the cold war. But it is a path not taken. 

Establish of UN: to find a way to end war, to facilitate the settlement of disputes among nations. Four year later, signing of the NATO treaty, 1949, as an alliance to aggression to USSR. "If the free nations do not stand together, they will fall one by one". US shifted from forming the union of nation to forming an alliance. Furthermore, UN become subordinate to the interest of NATO, for US and NATO countries. Country interest is above institutional scheme of UN.

Disband NATO: a re-unified Germany need to be a part of NATO. NATO enlargement to east europe countries, 1999. And it continued further on. "NATO will keep its door open for new members". At current moment, NATO's motivation become unclear. 

Washington Concensus: a global version of neo-liberalism. Deregulation, free trade and privatisation of nation owned asserts.

Formation and expansion of the european union. why a european union? 
1. Prevent war between France and German (commerical interchange create peace)
2. Counterbalance to US
3. Internal free trade with first mover advantages, externally protectionist trading block.
4. As a constraint on domestic politics
5. A federal European state (european identity)

What do they share in common? they are elite project, top-down enterprise, conceived by elites. There is little grass-root support. Strengthening of NATO is a source of obstacle to pan-europan identity because they contract out the national security of europe

##### Fusing Capitalist Economics with Communist Politics: China and Vietnam

China and Vietnam are the most successful example of "capitalist authoritarian regimes" and "post communist systems". "You cannot overstate the exploration of economics in China" 
World wide inequality have gone done while the inequality within countries increase. The price of reducing proverty is to tolerate increase in inequality. 
Challenge the accepted knowledge between democracy and economy. 
The path before June 4th. 
Deng Xiaoping -> Beijing Spring and democracy wall -> attack on the current government -> Pushback from the regimes. 

Why: Late development advantage?, Confuscian values?, Education? Less entrenched communist system? Gradual reform? Rule of law in the economy sector? Leadership?
- Rule of law in china is required by the foreign investment, if the foreign investment become less important, then the demand for the rule of law would be deminish. 
- Leadership that don't manage to renew itself drag their country down as they age. But some system provide some functionality to renew its leadership in some ways. Countries like China and Vietnam seems to find a way to solve the problems. 

How sustainable is this success? can we have long term successful authoritarian systems?
- state section seems to grow
- smile curve of profitability: most profits come from the R&D and custom service sectors, the two end of the product life cycle. It's not clear if they are going to be profitable
- Picking winners, in complex economies, it is more difficult to know where the next innovation of profit is going to be. So as economies grow and become complex, it is more difficult to make profit.
- break down of the leadership renewal & corruption
- break down of rule of law and increase in corruption and inefficiency
- demand for higher wages: [flying geese model](https://www.grips.ac.jp/forum/module/prsp/FGeese.htm), where the low profit section always goes to late comers. 
- Resurgence of political dissent

Sequencing of economic and political reforms: 
![[smile curve of profit.png]]
where the $y$ axis are index for economy. The demand for reform would occur when the economy fall down the proverty line. It was believed that reform D1 will lead to economy to crush down further so reformed should occur only at a later time. But this is not necessary correct. There are successes in both path.

Moderization theory's logic is not clear, because it is not clear where demand for change come from. Bourgeoisie? Working class pressure? Fighting and paying for war? 
Upshot for the future: 
Democracy is not inevitable, it depends on contingent historical struggles. Social maybe more repressive if facing modern challenges.
