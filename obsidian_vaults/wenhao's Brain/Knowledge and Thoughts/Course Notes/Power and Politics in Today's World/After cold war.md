These sessions focus on the a few specific new features of the world immediately after the end of cold world, such as new development in Russian, EU and East Asian, as well as the end of the cold war itself.

### From Soviet Communism to Russian Gangster Capitalism
Key incident of the collapse of USSR, 1991: [The August Coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27Ã©tat_attempt)
##### Collapse of USSR
**Why did the USSR collapse?** The USSR model is unsustainable, nobody believed in its political ideas and there are corruption everywhere. The western [containment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment) also worked. **Then, why was the collapse peaseful?** Shapiro cited the work *Exit, Voice and Loyalty* by Albert O. Hirschman that there are three things you can do if the organization you belong are failing: leave, complain or fix it yourself. *Royality and cost of these acts play an important role in the decision making*. In the case of Russia, the royality is low and so is the cost of exit, therefore, exit is the naturl result. There are little royalty here because of the widespread evidence of brazen corruption. The political costs of exiting the current regime are also decreased at that time since political elites have the preparation to exit for some times. And russia has a weak state at that time to prevent exiting. 

##### What did Russia transform to? 
At the begining of 21th century, Putin obtain power and become the leader of Russia. Putin adapted methods from capitalism to transform the state from a weak state to a stronger state, but only to serve his own interest. Russia is still inheritly corrupt. One important reason for Russia's corruption is its heavy dependence on a single industry, oil, that depend on natural resources. 

### A Unipolar World? NATO, the EU, & the Washington Consensus
Three lenses on Politics:
1. People's interest: realistic interest based decisions
2. Institutions: court, separation of power, institutional arrangement, may or may not align with people or countries' interest
3. Ideals: culture, norms that affect what actually happens in politics

>To say which is the right one is the wrong question, we should focus on under which conditions which view is more important. 
##### UN and NATO
After the second world war, UN was established aimed to find a way to end war, to facilitate the settlement of disputes among nations. However, four year later, when the NATO treaty is signed in 1949, as an alliance to counter the aggression to USSR. *US shifted from forming the union of nation to forming an alliance and UN become subordinate to the interest of NATO*, for US and NATO countries. Country interest is above institutional scheme of UN.

![[enlargement of NATO.png|500]]
Enlargement and expansion of NATO: A re-unified Germany need to be a part of NATO. NATO enlargement to east europe countries, 1999. And it continued further on. "NATO will keep its door open for new members". However, with the continuous enlargement, NATO's motivation become unclear. 
##### European Union
Formation and expansion of the european union. why a european union? 
1. Prevent war between France and German (commerical interchange create peace)
2. Counterbalance to US
3. Internal free trade with first mover advantages, externally protectionist trading block.
4. As a constraint on domestic politics
5. A federal European state (european identity)

What do these goals share in common? they are elite project, top-down enterprise, conceived by elites. There is little grass-root support. Strengthening of NATO is a source of obstacle to pan-europan identity because they contract out the national security of europe
##### Washington Concensus
Washington Concensus: a global version of neo-liberalism. Deregulation, free trade and privatisation of nation owned asserts.

### Fusing Capitalist Economics with Communist Politics
China and Vietnam are the most successful example of *capitalist authoritarian regimes* and *post communist systems* where "You cannot overstate the exploration of economics in China".

##### Sequencing of economic and political reforms
where the $y$ axis are index for economy. The demand for reform would occur when the economy fall down the proverty line. It was believed that reform D1 will lead to economy to crush down further so reformed should occur only at a later time. But this is not necessary correct. There are successes in both path.

##### Advance in Democracy
Path before June 4th: Deng Xiaoping, Beijing Spring and democracy wall, attack on the current government, Pushback from the regimes. 

Moderization theory's logic, of democractization are not clear, because it is not clear where demand for change come from. Bourgeoisie? Working class pressure? Fighting and paying for war? 
>Upshot for the future: Democracy is not inevitable, it depends on contingent historical struggles. Social maybe more repressive if facing modern challenges. 

##### Economy development in these countries
Why: Late development advantage?, Confuscian values?, Education? Less entrenched communist system? Gradual reform? Rule of law in the economy sector? Leadership?
- Rule of law in china is required by the foreign investment, if the foreign investment become less important, then the demand for the rule of law would be deminish. 
- Leadership that don't manage to renew itself drag their country down as they age. But some system provide some functionality to renew its leadership in some ways. Countries like China and Vietnam seems to find a way to solve the problems. 

How sustainable is this success? can we have long term successful authoritarian systems?
- state section seems to grow
- smile curve of profitability: most profits come from the R&D and custom service sectors, the two end of the product life cycle. It's not clear if they are going to be profitable
- Picking winners, in complex economies, it is more difficult to know where the next innovation of profit is going to be. So as economies grow and become complex, it is more difficult to make profit.
- break down of the leadership renewal & corruption
- break down of rule of law and increase in corruption and inefficiency
- demand for higher wages: [flying geese model](https://www.grips.ac.jp/forum/module/prsp/FGeese.htm), where the low profit section always goes to late comers. 
- Resurgence of political dissent

World wide inequality have gone done while the inequality within countries increase. The price of reducing proverty is to tolerate increase in inequality. 
Challenge the accepted knowledge between democracy and economy.
