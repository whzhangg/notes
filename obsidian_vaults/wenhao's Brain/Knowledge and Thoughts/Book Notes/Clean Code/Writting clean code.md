Preface and Introduction, Clean Code, Martin Robert C.

### Writting clean codes
Introduction by [James O. Coplien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Coplien)
>Honesty in small things is not a small thing. 

Clean code emphasis on *maintenance* rather than one *production*. The roots of responsibile professionalism in a profession should concern the life cycle of a product. We should not wait for break down or bugs to surface. This should be the exception. Rather, we should inspect the machine every day and fix wearing parts before they break, and eventually replacing the old machine with the new ones. 

>A Poem is never done and bears continual rework, and to stop working on it is adandonment. Such preoccupation with detail is common to all endeavors of excellence. 

*Style distinguishes excellence from mere competence*. Quanlity is the result of a million selfless acts of care--not just of any great method that descends from heavens. That these acts are simple doesn't mean that they are simplistic, and it hardly means that they are easy. The are nonetheless the fabric of  greatness and of beauty in any human endeavor. 

>Neither architecture nor clean clean code insist on perfection, only on honesty and doing the best we can.

**Boy Scout Rule**
Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

**Attitude**
This paragraph discussed the attitude towards writing clean code
>Have you ever waded through a mess so grave that it took weeks to do what should have taken hours? Have you seen what should have been a one-line change, made instead in hundreds of different modules? These symptoms are all too common.
>
>Why does this happen to code? Why does good code rot so quickly into bad code? We have lots of explanations for it. We complain that the requirements changed in ways that thwart the original design. We bemoan the schedules that were too tight to do things right. We blather about stupid managers and intolerant customers and useless marketing types and telephone sanitizers. *But the fault, dear Dilbert, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. We are unprofessional.*
>
>This may be a bitter pill to swallow. How could this mess be our fault? What about the requirements? What about the schedule? What about the stupid managers and the useless marketing types? Don’t they bear some of the blame?
>
>No. The managers and marketers look to us for the information they need to make promises and commitments; and even when they don’t look to us, we should not be shy about telling them what we think. The users look to us to validate the way the requirements will fit into the system. The project managers look to us to help work out the schedule. We are deeply complicit in the planning of the project and share a great deal of the responsibility for any failures; especially if those failures have to do with bad code!
>
>“But wait!” you say. “If I don’t do what my manager says, I’ll be fired.” Probably not. Most managers want the truth, even when they don’t act like it. Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the schedule. *They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that’s their job. It’s your job to defend the code with equal passion.*
>
>To drive this point home, what if you were a doctor and had a patient who demanded that you stop all the silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time? Clearly the patient is the boss; and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply. Why? Because the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of disease and infection. It would be unprofessional (never mind criminal) for the doctor to comply with the patient.
>
>So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.
