# Eichmann in Jerusalem
A report on the banality of evil
Hannah Arendt, 1963

I don't intend to completely describe the who content, but the important points that author made. 

##### Chapter 2. The Accused
The author start this chapter by describing that *Eichmann feels guilty before the God, not before the law*. The attitude of the defense is to plead not guilty because under the then existing Nazi legal system, he had not done anything wrong.

For Eichmann, he denied any killing of the Jews *by his own hand* and never gave an order to kill either a Jew or a non Jew. He believe that he can only be accused of *aiding and abetting* the annihilation of the Jews. Furthermore, "Those who today told Eichmann that he could have acted differently simply did not know how things have been."

Eichmann did not deny that he carried out these actions on purpose, but he denied guilty in the sense of indictment. He denied that he is *in full knowledge of the criminal nature of his deeds* and that he would have a bad conscience only if he had not done what he had been ordered to do. 

The judges considered this statement a lie and did not believe him because they find it difficult to admit that an average, normal person could be perfectly incapable of telling right from wrong and *he must have been aware of the criminal nature*, since he is examined by psychiatrists to be *normal* without legal insanity and more over, he has no case of insane hatred of Jews and he personally *never had anything whatever against Jews*. 

The author here commented that *Eichmann was indeed normal insofar as he was no exception within the Nazi regime, however, under the conditions of the Third Reich only exceptions could be expected to react normally*, meaning that under the then condition, even a normal person could behave as exception

Author go on to review the early life of Eichmann and how he joined the Nazi party, which "happened so quickly and suddenly", and "a leaf in the whirlwind of time, he was blown": he entered the party without desire to be properly informed and he did not even know the party program. 
>Kaltenburnner had said to him: why not join the S.S.? and he replied, why not? That was how it had happened, and that was about all there was to it.

As Eichmann understood it, the Nazi movement keeps moving forward and in which somebody like him, could start from scratch and still make a career. He is a man looking for significance and status in the social order. The author described that he might have preferred to be hanged as Obersturmbannfuhrer (lieutenant colonel) rather than living out his life quietly and normally as a travelling salesman. 

##### Chapter 3. An Expert on the Jewish Question
In this chapter, author continue to describe the experience of Eichmann in the S.S. and the status of the Jews in Nazi Germany. 

The Nuremberg laws had deprived the Jews of their political but not of their civil rights. They are no longer citizens but they remained members of the German state. For Eichmann, after he entered the special service, he studied the organizational setup of the Zionist movement, including its party members and programs in Germany. It earned him an assignment as official spy on the Zionist offices. His main schooling in Jewish affairs was almost entirely concerned with Zionism.

In 1938, he was sent to Austria to organize the emigration of Jews. Eichmann claimed the year in Vienna as his happiest and most successful period, during which under Eichmann, Austria was cleansed of 60% of its Jewish population. They are forced to leave the country or "otherwise you will go to a concentration camp". The main contribution of Eichmann in this is creating a better logistics for the processing of documents for the immigrates.

Eichmann claims that he is an *idealist* who had their feelings and emotions but would never permit them to interfere with his actions if they came into conflict with his ideas. He live for his ideas and would sacrifice for his idea everything and everybody.

He brags about what he has done, which is *the vice that was Eichmann's undoing*. He for a long time claims "I will jump into my grave laughing, because the fact that I have the death of five million Jews on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction" because it gave him an extraordinary sense of elation to think that he was exiting the stage in this way. 

Furthermore, the author wrote that "A more decisive faw in Eichmann's character was his total inability to look at anything from other fellow's point of view" and "the longer one listened to him, the more obvious it became that he has inability to speak and to think from standpoint of somebody else", which *stand as a reliable safeguards against reality as such*. In his own writting, he tells his experience in the tone of someone who was sure to find "normal, human" behavior in a "hard-luck" story: "I don't know, everything was as if under an evil spell, whatever I desired and wanted and planned to do, fate prevented it somehow, I was frustrated in everything, no matter what." It was as if he has no role in the suffering of others, which is the result of his doing. (The author gave an example of him meeting with a Jewish friend in the concentration camp, which he is a part of, and "he told me all his grief and sorrow" and he replied "we certainly got it! what rotten luch!")

The author wrote that the case of Eichmann is essentially different from the ordinary criminal who shield himself effectively against the reality only within the limit of his gang. For Eichmann, *he and the world he lived in had once been in perfect harmony* since the whole eighty million people in the German society had been shielded against reality and factuality by exactly the same means, the same self-deception, lies and stupidity that had now become ingrained in Eichmann's mentality. His astounding willingness to admit his crimes was due less to his own criminal capacity for self-deception than to the aura of systematic mendacity that had constituted the general atmosphere of the Third Reich. It is always his sense of elation that he considered important, not his conscience. 

The above habits of Eichmann (bragging, and ignorant of the reality) have created considerable difficulty during the trial for those who had come to prosecute him, to defend him and to judge him. The author claimed him to be not a *monster* but a *clown*, but the court cannot accept this because *this suspicion would have been fatal to the whole enterprise, and was also rather hard to ustain in view of the sufferings he and his like had caused to millions of people*.

##### Chapter 4. The First Solution: Expulsion
When Eichmann started to work on the solution of immigration of the Jews, it was in the interest of the Jews to get out of the country and Eichmann is the *one who had to help them, one had to help these functionaries to act, and that's what I did*. Author wrote "True, he could not foresee at the time the coming Final Solution, but he had saved them, that was a fact".

In the first stage of the Jewish policy, the National Socialists adopted a pro-Zionist attitude. The German Jews themselves thought it would be sufficient to undo "assimilation" throught a process of "dissimilation" and flock into the ranks of the Zionist movement. Even Hitler's rise to power appeared to the Zionists as "a decisive defeat of assimilationism" and they cooperated with the Nazi authorities. Their chief enemy, prior to the extermination program, was not those who made life impossible for Jews in the old countries like Germany or Austria, but those who barred access to the new homeland, Britain. 

As for Eichmann, he showed his mettle and in Vienna, he was recognized not merely as an expert on the Jewish question, the intricacies of Jewish organizations and Zionist parties, but as an authority on emigration and evacuation, as the master who knew how to make people move. However, As the war went on, the avenues for emigration overseas became clogged up and the possibility of escape within Europe had been exhausted. 

##### Chapter 5. The Second Solution: Concentration
In 1941, Eichmann is appointed in the office that handle Catholics, Protestants, Freemasions and Jews department in R.S.H.A. in S.S., under Muller, who obied Heydrich under the command of Himmler. Apart from S.S., there is also a network of higher S.S. and police leaders who were in command of the regional organization and do not connect to the department of Eichmann. They played an important role in the Final solution but often outrank Eichmann the men at his disposal. 

Eichmann's position is not very high, but an important one. Even in 1943 when the Jewish problem had grown to fantastic proportions, he was still the only office that officially dealt with nothing but the Jews. Although other forces, offices, state, party and army are all involved in solving the Jewish problem. 

When Eichmann entered his new position, he was confronted with the dilemann that on the one hand the "force emigration" was the official formula and on the other, "emigration was no longer possible". Nonetheless, he tried to purpose three ideas, which are unsuccessful, to emigrate the Jews. The inexhaustible source of trouble was that he and his men were never left alone, all those other parties wanted their share in the "solution"

The author here described Eichmann's main plan, the first of them is to move the Jew population to the east part of Poland, which is not considered a part of the Reich (General Govenment). The second plan is to move them to Madagascar, however, although Eichmann tried to work out detailed plan for the evacuation of Jews to Madagascar, The Madagascar plan was always meant to serve as a clock under which the preparation of the physical extermination of the Jews could be carried forward. So that when, a year later, the Madagascar plan was declared obsolete, everybody was logically prepared for the next step: since there is no tettitory to which one could "evacuate", the only solution is to exterminate.

At that time, various offices in the Reich is involved in the killing of the Jews, but there was not unified policy, each office had its own solution. Eichmann's solution was a police state and for that he needed a sizable territory, so his efforts failed as the war went on and at one moment he understood "that was the end of his dreams and the end of the era of searching for a solution in the interest of both sides". It become clear for Eichmann that "the evacuation and deportation" was no longer the last stages of the solution. His department merely become instrumental. He even need to apply to find out the ultimate desitination of each shipment of Jews. 

##### Chapter 6. The Final Solution: Killing
In the begining of this chapter, author described how Eichmann dealt with the order of killing. Eichmann recalled that he, never belong to the higher party circles, was told by Heydrickthat "the fuhrer has ordered the physical extermination of the Jews." and then he understood and "did't say anything because there was nothing to say any more, for I had never thought of such a thing, such a solution through violence" and he "lost all the joy in his work". 

The author described Eichmann's involvement in the killing and he Eichmann visited the killing center and felt disguest about the killing. The author then claim that two important questions of the trial of Eichmann was answered: 1) Is Eichmann aware of what he was doing, since he had been involved in the transport but not directly in the killing and 2) Is he in a position to judge the enormity of his deeds, and *Both questions now were answered in affirmative: he had seen the places to which the shipment were directed and he had been shocked out of his wits*.

The author then go on to describe whether Eichmann *had done his acts in order to save himself from the danger of immediate death*. It is concluded that the answer is NO, he was not in any danger of immediate death and since he claimed with great pride that he had always done his duty, he take great pride that he had "done his duty". Therefore, the case is settled.

Author described the general atomsphere in Germany at the time about the issue of *conscienceness* and concluded that there are instance in which Eichmann had tried to save Jews. There are also people who rebel under the Nazi regime, whose fundamental reason for rebel is not because of the inhuman crime of the regime and the fact that other people will be made to suffer, but the *fact that Hitler was preparing war* or *their conviction of the coming defeat and ruin of Germany*. 

There are also "voice of conscience" across Germany, but most of them are slient and their voices were never heard, who "preferred having his independent existence destroyed and becoming a simple worker in a factory to taking upon himself the little formality of entering the Nazi party." Inside the Nazi party, the problem of conscience is avoided by creating a different reality and change the instincts of people around.
