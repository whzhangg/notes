Let's determine some rules for this note book
# Rules
### File Rules
##### Title
1. Use Headline 5 (`#####`) as the inner most subsection headline.
2. Use Headline 3 (`###`) as the section headline
3. Use Headline 1 (`#`) as the page headline
4. It looks like a bad idea to put more level on the same page. If you are attempted to include things like subsubsections, it's *better to split pages*

##### Lists and enumerate
Don't over use them: do not put paragraphs in list or enumerations. 

##### File names
1. Capitalize first letter
2. space between words
3. If multiple file start with the same name, put them in folders

### Folder structures
##### Main folders:
Let's think about what should be placed here first: I don't want to store useless knowledge. I think I should put the following two categories here:
1. *Knowledge and Thoughts*: Knowledge and thoughts for long term memory.
2. *Notes* Facts I want to come back to again and again.
3. *Collections* Interesting things I read but I don't want to keep them in my mind all the times.
For other types of things, notebooks application is perhaps more suitable.
