Let's determine some rules for this note book
# Rules
##### Title
1. Use Headline 5 (`#####`) as the inner most subsection headline.
2. Use Headline 3 (`###`) as the section headline
3. Use Headline 1 (`#`) as the page headline
4. It looks like a bad idea to put more level on the same page. If you are attempted to include things like subsubsections, it's better to split pages

##### Lists and enumerate
Don't over use them: do not put paragraphs in list or enumerations. 

##### File names
1. Capitalize first letter
2. space between words
3. If multiple file start with the same name, put them in folders
