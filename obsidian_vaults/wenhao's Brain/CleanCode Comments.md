Clean code, Robert C. Martin, Chapter 4.
### Comments
>So when you find yourself in a position where you need to write a comment, think it through and see whether there isn't some way to turn the tables and express yourself in code. Every time you express yourself in code, you should pat yourself on the back. Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression.
>Truth can only be found in one place:  the code. Only the code can truly tell you what it does. It's the only source of truely accurate information.
