This is a style guide from University of Oxford guide for official documents

### Common rules in writting text:
##### Date and time
Always put date before the month, without ‘th’ etc - just the number and month - and never precede the number with ‘the’. For example “Easter this year is on 13 April”

##### Punctuations
For a plural, if the word look odd when an s is added, consider italicising it or place it in single quotation. For example Substract all the *x*s from the *y*s.

##### Brackets
Round brackets are used to include extra information, definition, translation, dates or explanation
    
The punctuation should be after the closing bracket, unless the bracket is a complete sentence. The following two usages are correct:
1. The last bus today is at 4.45 (which is earlier than usual).
2. The last bus today is at 4.45. (That’s earlier than usual.)

##### Square brackets
They are used to enclose comments, corrections or reference only.

##### Bullet points
The following points is noted for bullet points in writting.
-   If the bullet is just a list of items. We do not need to punctuate them
-   If the bullet points form a complete sentence along with the preceding text. We should add a periodic in the end of the last point;
-   If the text inside the bullet point is a complete sentence, add semicolon ; to the end of each point. A full stop to the end of the last point, and ‘or’ or ‘and’ to the end of the penultimate point.

For example: 
>The following will be considered good reasons for missing the final meeting of the year:
>- you are absent as a result of illness;
>- there is something more interesting happening elsewhere which you would rather attend; or
>- you have obtained a ticket to see the Spice Girls in concert.

##### Colon and semicolon
A colon introduce a subclause which follows logically from the text before it. Do not use colon if the two parts of the sentence are not logically connected.

Use semicolon to link two related parts of a sentence that can standalone as gramatically complete sentence but depends logically on each other

##### Comma
Use a pair of commas only to surround a non-defining clause, one which can be removed without losing the meaning of the sentence. In this case, only ‘which’ and ‘who’ can be used in this type of clause, not ‘that’

Use comma after an introductory adverb, adverbial phrase or subordinate clause, or use a pair of commas surround it if it is in the middle of a sentence. For example: 
>It was, however, too late for that.

Do not use comma after a time based adverbial phase: 
>In 2010 the most popular game was hopscotch.

Use comma between multiple qualitative adjectives: 
>He was a big, fat, sweaty man.

Do not use use comma between multiple classifying adjectives:
>It was an edible German mushroom

##### Dash
*em-dash* is to be avoided. See the difference between en-dash and em-dash [here](https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/en-dash.html)

*en-dash* is used in place of round brackets or commas, surrounded by spaces. Use singly n-dash with space to link two parts of a sentence, in place of a colon
Also, we can use n-dash to link concepts or ranges of numbers with no space either side. $2500-$5000; German-Polish non-agression pact

##### Hypen
When to use hyphen:
1.  In an adjectival phrase before a noun: the *up-to-date* list, a *hot-air* ballon
2.  In an adjectival phrase including a verb participle: The jumper was *tight-fitting*
3.  With prefixes only if required to avoid confusion, such as where prefixed themselves are repeated: *pre-eminent; re-release*
4.  prefixes before a formal name, number or data: *mid-January*, *pre-2000*
5.  In numbers that are spelt out: *twenty-seven*, *Thirty-Nine*
6.  Compass point: *south-east*
When not to use hyphen
1.  In between two noun words
2.  To make a new compound noun, if it is a recognisable concept, make it one word; if it is not, use two words: *Websites*; *email* (not *e-mail*)
3.  In adjectival phrase following a noun
4.  In adjectival phrase before a noun (when to 2.) but where the first word end with -ly: *well-formed* is correct, but *highly-respected* is not correct.

##### Ellipsis
We can have two usage for ellipsis ("...''):
1. Use an ellipsis to show some text is missing. Do not surround it with space
2. Use an ellipsis to indicate a pause, in this way ellipsis can be replaced by a comma. Follow the ellipsis with a space: *You don’t have to be mad to work here... but it helps*

##### Full stop and question mark
Only use a question mark for a direct question.

##### Quotation marks
Use single quotation for direct speech or quote, and double quotation marks for quotation within that. Use no quotation marks if quote is displayed by itself

Use single quotation marks and roman for titles that are not whole publications. For example: poems, short stories, songs, chapters. Full name, such as book names, should be used without quotation and in italic.

Punctuation is placed inside the quotation marks if it belong to the content of quotation. Place any punctuation which does not belong to the quote outside, except when closing punctuation is at the end of the quote.
>‘Bob’, I said, ‘likes cheese.’

##### Highlighting and emphasis
Bold text:
Punctuation which follows bold text should not itself be bold.

Italic:
-   Use italic to flag part of the text that is different from the surroundings
-   Use italics for foreign words and phrases embedded in your text

Underlining:
Avoid using underlining for emphasis, this generally suggests hyperlinks

### Others writting rules
##### URLs
Three rules when we include urls in our article:
1. omit http:// if URL start with www.
2. omit any trailing slash at the end of URL if possible
3. For secure website, always include https://

##### Email addresses
The part of email before @ are case sensitive, although in practice, the major service providers ignore the distinction. But it’s better to distinct upper and lower case to avoid ambiguity)
