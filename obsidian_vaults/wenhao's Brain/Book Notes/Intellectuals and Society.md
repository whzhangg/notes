```

## Part 1. Introduction

Chapter 1. Intellect and intellectuals

Chapter 2. Knowledge and Notions

## Part 2. Intellectuals and Economics

**Chapter 3. Income distribution**

**Chapter 4. Economic Systems**

- **Chaos vs. Competition**: Economy system conveys scarcity, instead of causing scarity itself, and systemic factors determines the general outcome of a  free economy system, creating a pattern, instead of chaos

**Chapter 5. Government and the economy**

- **Resessions and depressions**: author argued about the role of government in the greate depression

## Part 3. Intellectuals and Social Visions

**Chapter 6. A Conflict of Visions**

- **Opposing social visions**: *Anointed vision*: problems of the society are created by the organizations and solutions can be found by the anointed elite who will lead others towards better life. *Tragic vision*: foundamental problem of the society are due to the inherent shortcomings of human beings, that cannot be overcome by changing organization, commpassion and commitment or other virtues
- **The Left-Right dichotomy**: in this chapter, left and right political views are discussed.
- **Youth and age**: In this chapter, the view of education from the two opposing vision are discussed

**Chapter 7. Abstract people in an abstract world**

- **Dispartities and their causes**: the disparities are blamed on discrimination, sometimes on genes, but in any event the disparities are treated as odds that need explaining, no matter how common such supposed oddities are in countries around the world. The wide spread use of an even proportionally distributed society as a benchmark from which to measure maltreatment by others, is taken as axiomatic, not because empirical support but because that benchmark is a foundation for other social beliefs and agendas
- **Equality**: many of what are called social problems are differences between the theories of the intellectuals and the realities of the world, differences which many intellectuals interpret to mean that it is the real world that is wrong and needs changing (for example, equality, which is not achievable in practical sense)

**Chapter 8. Arguments with arguments**

**Chapter 9. Patterns of the Anointed**

- **Change vs the status quo**: it is doubtful whether there are many, if any, individuals in a free society in a free society who are completely satisfied with all the policies and institutions of their society. "Everyone is progressive by their own lights". Everyone is in favor of some changesm but all of this is bypassed by those who simply proclaim themselves to be in favor of change and label those who disagree with them as defenders of the status quo.
- **Attitudes vs Principles**: Attitudes of the anointed can change over time, there is no principle that accounts for such collective mood swings. They are simply mascots du jour, but seldom treated as subject to logic or evidence during either the period of their obsession or the period of their dismissal.
- **Crusades of the anointed**: people's words or even thoughts may not reflect their actual behavior pattern. If the real purpose of social crusades is to proclaim oneself to be on the side of the angels, then investigations to the acutal consequence have low priority, if priority at all.

## Part 4. Optional Reality

**Chapter 10. Filtering reality** 

(the first thing a man will do for his ideals is lie)

- **selective samples**: only show or report informations that fits the vision to be portrayed, even if what is portrayed does not fit the facts
- **suppressing facts**: once "they" found statistics to support their preconception, they had no incentive to go any further
- **Fictitous people**: filtering information can create fictitious people that fits the vision of the intellectuals, instead of how they really are. The fictitious individuals and nations have characteristics that are not merely different from, but the direct opposite of, those of the flesh-and-blood peopleto whom they are supposed to correspond.
- **verbal cleansing and impartiality**: verbal cleansing: changing the use of words to create an new imagine of themselves. Impartiality: what makes an activity scientific is that it use methods devised to get at the truth, not to support one belief or another, and **scientific methods are "rules of procedure" which can "crush out ideologically conditioned error" from an analysis.** The question is not being on "which sides" or "being fair to which side" what is far more important is being **honest with the readers**

**Chapter 11. Subjective Truth**

## Part 5. Intellectuals and the Law

**Chapter 12. Changing the Law**

This chapter focus on how should the law be interpreted and what is the responsibity of Judges. The author’s view is that law should be understood “as it is” and the power of the Judge should be restrained. The author cited British Jurist Sir Pollock Holmes that “The judge’s job is to read the law intelligently, and a consideration of consequences comes into play, if at all, only when the meaning of the words used is open to reasonable doubt”. Law is written for citizens and provide instructions on what can or cannot be done. Therefore, any interpretion of  the “original intent” of law, instead of the actual text given by law, is persional and cannot form the base for the rule of law.

**Chapter 13. Law and Results**

- **Burdens of Proof**: The procedure that accusers should have the burden of proof to show that their rights are valiated should be followed consistently. i.e. The burden should not be placed on the defender, so that certain outcome that fits the vision of certain group can be achieved. (Wards Cove case: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wards_Cove_Packing_Co._v._Atonio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wards_Cove_Packing_Co._v._Atonio) and revision of the civial rights act 1991)
- **Property Rights**: Individual property rights should be treated on the same ground as free speech rights, and be regarded an important social process that provide ground for market economy decision making. The trend to reduce the importance of property rights granted by law give opportunity for one group to benefit from the loss of the other group
- **Crime**: the notion of the anointed has de-emphasized punishment and emphasized prevention by getting at the social root cause of crime before hand. Although there is no evidence that an increased personal wealth and educations lead to a lower crime rate and strict punishment and enforcement lead to much lower crime rate, such as in countries like Singapore. However, the facts are dismissed by the anointed who believe their vision.

## Part 6. Intellectuals and War

**Chapter 14. The World Wars**

“It is too true, however disgraceful it maybe to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it.” The author suggested that the anointed try to impose their vision on how to achieve peace, rely on international negotiations or disarmament agreements, even that vision eventually result in the outbreak of war and cost the lives of millions. Pacifists of that era seemed not to think of other nations as prospecitive enemies but of war itself as the enemy. They pursue their vision to dipict wars as result of national emotions or attitudes, which can be corrected by education, while ignoring the facts that war is consequence of self-interest of aggressive rulers. They played a negative role that allow Nazi Germany to expand with their pacifism and inaction in the world wars.

**Chapter 15. The Cold War and Beyond**

Repeating the same argument, the author go on to describe how intellectuals influence the war in Vietnem, Cold war and the war in Iraq. The intellectuals notion that “war solve nothing”, “war is our enemy” and “deterrent only lead to war” is taken to be unquestionable axiom, although they are not explained and is often shown by facts in history to be false.

## Part 7. Intellectuals and Race

Chapter 16. Disparities and Their Causes

Chapter 17. Race and Intelligence

**Chapter 18. Liberalism and Multiculturalism**

In the liberal era, many of the socioeconomic difference between races are attributed to racism, but alternative explanations are seldom taken seriously by the intelligentsia. The premise that racial problem was essentially one inside the mind of white people, instead of anything physical, genetic or economical, simplified the task of those intelligentsia who did not have to research many bahavioral differences between the black and whites and enable them to take the moral high ground in the society they live in.

In the multicultural era, culture diversity is advocated , trying to get minority groups to conform to the practice and norms of the larger society around them are viewed negatively by multiculturalists as a form of cultural imperialism. Perpetuating cultural features as if they were butterfies preserved in amber, and use verbal virtuosity to make this seems like cosmic justice, condems the groups that are lagging behind to needless handicaps in the real world, where concrete capabilities matter more than purely symbolic equality. Furthermore, it fragments the society into segments. 

**Chapter 19. Race and Cosmic Justice**

In this chapter, the author critize the practice of people seek to undo disparities created by disparities. The intelectuals automatically transform differences of inequities and inequities into evils of shortcomings of society, and try to compensate the victims for the lack of capabilities and other negative facts and consider them into mere preceptions by the society. They expect different groups to think and bahave just like they did in the past but yet somehow get better results in the future as a result of cosmic justice, and if they don’t get better results, this will be considered as the fault of the society. Achieving the same result as others, without having to change, in order to acquire the same cultrual prerequisites that others acquired withoutc change, would be cosmic justice, but it is not a promising agenda in the real world. 

The inherent conflict of these different legitimate desires and interests in each of the groups is really a part of the tragedy of human condition, contrasting to a simple moral melodrama starring the intelligentsia on the side the angels against the forces of evil

## Part 8. An Overview

**Chapter 20. Patterns and Visions**

The role of intellectuals in society should be judged by what they do. Not what they say they do or even they think what they do, but what in fact are their actions and the social consequences of these actions

- value premises vs assumption of facts: either internal value premises or assumptions about facts of the external world can form the basis of conclusions on why things are what they are, or what is desirable in individual life. The value premise explanation, attributing different view and opinion as different value premises with oneself, seems to be more widely accepted, being an easier and more convenient solution. But fundamentally, it is really the difference between how people preceive the world that is enough to generate sweeping array of opposing views.
- Being a intellectual does not necessary mean having a high intellectual standards. Many people quote anti-intellectualism as an attack on intellectuals but they seldom wonder the fact that the public honor intellectual achievements in science, engineering or the medical prefession, which also exhibit high intellectual ability.

**Chapter 21. Incentives and Constraints**

- Over supply of public intellectuals, those who go beyond their speciality to address problems at public, creates an notion that they are needed, to offer solutions to social problems, although how they are justified for solution or even whether the problem exist is taken as axiom that is not questioned. Therefore, the demand for public intellectuals are larged manufactured by themselves.

**Chapter 22. The Influence of Intellectuals**

author conclude the book by listing many consequence of intellectuals’ influence on our society, including how they abstract us from the feeling and experience that we feel around us ( Anyone who thinks that a mother is not important to a child or a child to a mother has no understanding of human beings. and to project that sense of their unimportance onto the people themselves is one of the many violations of fundamental intellectual standards by intellectuals) 

The sense of cognitive elite divide society into two parts and for people living in encapsulated worlds, it is difficult for them, even with good intentions, to grasp the realities of worlds with which they have little experience, but over which they have great influence. We should not compare society to ideals, which virtually guarantees that our vision of society will be condemned as a failure, if only because it cost nothing to imagine something better than what exists, while everything created in the real world has a cost.

We should be also aware of politicians, whose ambitions not only may find intellectuals useful, but also themselves face incentives similar to those intellectuals and can therefore consititute similar dangers.

Finally, author suggest: However few are the constraints on what the intelligentsia choose to do in their work, the role that they aspire to play in society at large can be achieved by them only to the extent that the rest of society accepts what they say uncritically and fail to examine their track record. We should have the will to resist.
