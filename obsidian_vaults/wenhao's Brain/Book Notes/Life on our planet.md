A Vision for the Future: How to Rewild the World

Here the author suggested that sustainability in the growth is an important challenge and it is not only necessary that halt and reverse our invasion to nature as it is, but also to do it while maintaining and improving our social foundation, such as stability, justice, health food supply for people everywhere on the planet.

1. Moving beyond growth
    
    It is necessary at this moment to refrain ourselves from our desire of “perpetual growth” of world economy. Our world is finite on earth and nothing can increase forever. “The only way to achieve perpetual growth is to take more from elsewhere” and “what feels like a miracle of the modern age was just steeling”. The author suggested that things can thrive without necessary getting bigger, there can be much variaty eventhough the “footprint” of our life does not increase much more. A sustainable economy, prioritise people and the planet, is more important than economy simply based on GDP.
    
2. Moving to renewable energies
    
    It is very essential that our energy consumption is moved from fossil fuel to renewable energies. There are three main difficulties for such move, the technology capability, price and incentives. We need to encourage renewable energies in the form of carbon tex, but a better way is recover the natural environments and let them capture carbon for us. In this way, we are also able to increase the biodiversity.
    
3. Rewilding the seas
    
    Controlled development of the sea is very important, not only for sustainable fishing, but also for the biodiversity of the ocean and its contribution to store carbon. Fishing should be strictly regulated so that it is sustainable. Marine protected areas can be very effective to maintain the fish population. Farming resources (aquaculture) from the ocean should be done with care and careful planning. Furthermore, underwater forest with Kelp (a kind of seaweed) can be a great way to recovery biodiversity as well as effective carbon storage and conversion.
    
4. Taking up less space
    
    To conserve and revert biodiversity and wild habitat, we need to reduce the land we take for farming. We can use better technologies or sustainable way to produce more food with limited land. Method such as urban farming and vertical farming are good alternative if renewable energies are used. Furthermore, we have to transition our diet from meat based to plant based. Meat diet is inefficient in terms of energy utilization and space, since the energy of the sum, absorbed by plants, are first consumed by animals and then by us. Alt-proteins and synthesized meat will be good alternatives that we can go for in the future as well.
    
5. Rewilding the land
    
    Here the author describe what we need to do to bring the forest back. Although in europe and america, reforestation is taking place, but in developing countries deforestation is still accelerating, it is important we prevent this immediately, by, for example, subside. From wild land we are able to extract many useful resources,  using the “wild approach to farming” that follow the natrual status of the wild. The final goal is to increase the biodiversity and let nature to regulate the wild land by itself, which is a much faster and better process. 
    
6. Planning for peak human
    
    We should plan for the peak of human popluation. There are four stages of demographic development that most countries must experience. 1) high birth rate and death rate, 2) high birth rate and death rate decrease, 3) birth rate decrease and 4) equilibrium of low birth and death rate. Our world is now at the 3rd stages and we should plan for the arrival of the fourth stages. Investing to improve social and economical situtation, including eduation of woman, are important ways to decrease birth rate and help us transit to the 4th stage. Author also noted that it is possible for a 5th stage where total population decrease and we should help solutions to the problems that come.
    
7. Achieving more balanced lives
    
    Recycle is very important a sustainable life, especially for our technology cycle. We can transform our cities to be more sustainable, that is green and environmental friendly. We will loss our convenience in this process, but we will gain much more on other things.
    

### Conclusion

Our Greatest Opportunity

Author conclude by saying that what we do will define a time for earth. Nature will survive and wild will return, with or without us. The living world has survived mass extinctions several times before, but we humans cannot assume that we will do the same
