### Does Size Matter?
##### Chapter 1. Genius and Madness
Does Brain size have a strong correlation with IQ? No, the correlation is weak in terms of statistical average. 

But is it fair to use only the volume as a parameter? Brain (cortex) are divided into different parts and it is believed that each part of the cortex has different functions. This is called cerebral localzationism, which is first observed from observing that the people who suffer damage in different parts of the brain lost different functions. It later seems that the size of frontal and parietal lobes have a higher correlation with IQ, however, the correlation is still relatively weak.

Author go on to show a few example of brain abnormality (autism and schizophrenia) that are related to larger brain volumn, and still is not well understood. The lesson here is *most of us are convinced that minds differ because brains differ, so far, however, there is little proof* and we still understand very poorly the mechanism of our brain.

##### Chapter 2. Border Disputes
How our brain change as we learn new things? it seems that it is possible to develop the corresponding part of the brain (make it larger) by exercising it. However, there is no direct evidence showing that the enlargement (cortical thickening) is the result of learning.

People after stoke suffer from disability (speech, body control) caused by damage of part of the brain, usually patients recover some of their functionalities after month to some degree, indicating that the brain can fix some of its parts while some functionalities are lost permanently.  Some of the damage can be irreversible, indicating that the brain reassigned some functions to other parts. Similar process also happens for people who had amputations (arm or leg loss). The part of the brain corresponding to the control and feeling of these missing parts are assigned to other functionalities, 

Overall, the brain has an organization that are much more complicated. 

### Connectionism
![[SingleNeuronStructure.png]]
##### Chapter 3. No Neuron is an island
Neurons are densely packed in our brain. Two neurons make connection by each other by forming a structure called synapse. Information is passed through the junction with chemical signal, using molecules known as ‘neurotransmitter’ and ‘receptor’. Neurons only pass message where synapse is formed, instead of anywhere two neuron touch. There are more than a hundred neurotransmitters with corresponding receptors. Drug molecules can also activate receptors, this is how chemicals are able to change our mind. Within the neurons, signals are carried by electric pulse. 

Neurons have multiple dendrites and a single axon. Dendrites are the receiving end of synapses and contain receptor molecules. Axons send signals to other neurons by transmitters. The electric signal are pikes that pass through axon which secrete the transmitters. At the dendrites, they are again converted to electric signal. Such connection is directional and is called a pass-way.

Not all signals can pass along the neuron systems. The electrical effect of a single neurotransmitter is weak and cannot causes spikes on its own. The spikes are the result of votings between neurons, but the resulting spikes are only binary: either activate or inactivate. Furthermore, there are two types of neurons that give spikes of negative votes and positive votes to the later neurons. The negative votes can cancel positive votes and resulting the fellow neurons to be inactive.

##### Chapter 4. Neurons all the Way Down
The unity of mind is just an illusion hiding the spikes and secretions of large number of neurons. We can consider that the activation of a small population of the neurons, linked together, defines a pattern of perceptions. The author defines the function of neuron by its connections with other neurons. Perception of the environments is the association of an idea to external stimulus, while thoughts is the association of an idea to another idea. The activation of the neurons along its pass-way naturally gives the association of activations. 

When some neurons in our brain are activated by a stimulus, their activations cause other related neurons to activate. The activation of all the related neurons defines a larger patterns that could correspond to our experiences. This is how we can recollect our previous experiences. The weighting system here play an important role. If the activations are unrestrained, then too much spread of activation causes confusion. A single stimulus (vision, smell) could sometimes unable to cause activations and we may need multiple stimulus to lead to a collective activation that define an experience.

##### Chapter 5. The Assembly of Memories
How the memory are stored in the first place? The connection of the neurons are through the synapses. They can strengthen or weaken (reweighting, by increase the amount of transmitter and receptor), the connections can also be created or lost (reconnection). It is believed that memories are formed by reweighting and reconnection mechanisms. The idea is that 

If two neurons are repeatedly activated simultaneously, the connection between them are strengthened in both direction, If they are repeated activated in sequence, their connections are strengthen in the given direction. These two mechanism let us build connections between things that happen at the same time or in a given sequence. On the other hand, the connection of the neurons seems to be weakened if one is repeatly activate while another is inactive. It is purposed that the strengthening of some connections will lead to the weakening of other neuron connections, 

The connection between neurons are sparse in our brain, how can two neurons of two related ideas associated with each other in the first place. First, ideas are redundantly represented by many neurons so that there are more changes for two neurons to connect. Secondly, synapse creation between neurons could be a random process. Synapse can be created, but also eliminated if they are not used for learning within a few days. 

Apart from the memories that are stored by the synapses, there are also short term memories that persist shortly after the initial stimulus is gone. This seems to be caused by the self-sustaining activations of the group of related neuron assemblies. These kind of persistent spiking retain information for seconds. The two different types of memory mechanism have different functions. The short term sustain is very adaptive while the connections changes more slowly but are more stable over a longer time periods.

### Nature and Nurture
##### Chapter 6. The Forestry of the Genes
It is accepted that the bobdy inherits traits from parents for the body, but the same is true for the mind, although not as strong as that of the body, because the mind could be shaped at a later stage.  The study of twins indeed suggest that genetic factors account for the mental difference and mental disorder. 

Genes decide the assemble of proteins. Since chemical process play an important role in mental functions, defect in genes can therefore cause defects in the chemical processes if the defects is related to DNA sequence for a receptor or ion channel. There are also other possibility for malfunction from defect DNA that affect the development of the brain.

The development of the brain can be divided into four steps: 1) creation of the neuron cells, 2) migration of the neuron cells, 3) extend branches and  4) make connections. The first two steps of brain development occur before the baby is born, by that time the creation and migration of the neurons are virtually complete. After that, neurons continue to grow branches, called the ‘wiring’ of the brain, and the strongest growth is that of the axons. For most part, the axon grow straight. Once the growth reaches its final destination, the axon starts to branch. Such growth is guided by some guidence molecules that axon head can sense. As the wiring of the brain is mostly done, the connection begin to form, by a process that is both random and genetic. Many of the unused connections are destoried as well in this process. Any problem in the DNA that govern these development process is likely lead to mental disorder.

Finally, in this chapter, the author argued that it is important to study how the mental disorder is related to the mis-wiring of the brain, instead of only finding the reasons from the DNA, since we cannot change DNA and ‘re-develop’ the brain afterwards, but we can perhaps fix mis-wiring of the brain, if we know the problem.

##### Chapter 7. Renewing Our Potential
In this chapter, the author discuss whether we have the potential to change our brain in adulthood. Early theory of connectome determinism denies the possibility of significant changes in the brain after adulthood, that the connections are mostly fixed. From the empirical evidence that it is observed that children seem to learn much faster than adults do. However, it is found that in adult brain, still significant reconnections are possible, although less than that in children. Therefore, reconnection denial is not possible.

A second form is ‘rewiring denial’. The neurons in our brains are mostly connected to nearby neurons. Longer connections also exist, but only from a certain region to another region. This is called ‘connectional fingerprint” because the interconnections seems to be unique for different regions. For example, Brodmann area 3 is connected to pathways of touch, temperature and pain from the spinal cord. 

Lashley’s doctrine points out that a brain area only has the potential to learn if the necessary wiring with other part of the brain exist. For example, if if the visual pathway is rewired to the cortex area that is responsible for listening, that part of the area would take the function of seeing. 

Some studies shows that there is an critical period for the learning of language and social behaviors in children. Depriving the environment inputs at the early stage in life caused axons to retract dramatically. Suggesting the ability to rewire connections is important for learning. For example, experiment on changing the environment input (changing visual input) cause the causing the visual axon to shift across the corresponding area in visual processing, suggesting that the remapping is caused by rewiring, especially at an early stage.

However, rewiring is still possible for adults and is not fully suppressed. Similarly, the creation and destruction of neurons also play a role. It is believed that neuron growth can still occur at adult stage, which can be called ‘regeneration’ 

Overall, reweighting, reconnection, rewiring and regeneration are the methods that brain develop its functions. Reweighting and reconnections occur throughout the learning process while rewiring andregeneration are more stable at an adult stage. 

### Connectomics
From here the author start to described some of the approaches to study connectomic.
##### Chapter 8. Seeing is believing
The author described the method for brain imaging, including the imaging at the early stage and the methods using light and electron microscope.
##### Chapter 9. Following the Trail
Author describes some promising methods for mapping our neuron connection in the brain, starting from the early method used by Sydney Brenner to map the connection in C. elegans and recent methods of automation using machine learning and image treatment. 
##### Chapter 10. Carving
The author mainly described the partitioning of the brain and author purpose that we should divide the brain by connection, both the regional connection and the neuron connections
##### Chapter 11. Codebreaking
The author purposed that we can verify our understanding of connectome by studying memory and find the relationship between memory and signals in our brain.
##### Chapter 12. Comparing
The understand the difference between individual, it is important to compare the difference between our brain and author purpose to use optical microscope to map the connections in white matter, which is relatively easier to trace. 
![[WhiteMatterGrayMatter.png]]

The *gray matter* near the cortex contain a mixture of all parts of neurons: cell body, dendrites, synapses and axons, while the *white matter* contains only axons. The axons in the white matter connect different regions of the brain, some axons enter the gray matter close to where they started while some connect to regions that are further away. 90% of the axons connect different regions in the cortex while the remaining 10% connect cortex with cerebellum, brainstem and others. 

Tracing the connection between these axions in the white matter is more conveninent and they are enough to find regional connection, which is a first step to understand the difference and similarity between individuals.
##### Chapter 13. Changing
The author discussed some approaches where we can develop drugs that will help us change the brain.

### Beyond Humanity
##### Chapter 14. To Freeze or to Pickle?
here the author mainly discuss about the possibility to continue “living” even if the body has died.The author discussed about method to perserve our brain without damaging it and definition of death if such method is really possible.

##### Chapter 15. Save As...
Is it possible to simulate the function of brain so that we can have an electronic version of ourself? The author discussed the difficult of simulating the brain and discussed how can we judge if such operation is successful in the future. The author point out that if by so called ‘brain uploading’, our friends and ourselves can be satisfied, then such technique to “export” our brain to machines can be considered successfully, and “the real difficulty is not philosophical but practical”. Progress have been made but it is still difficult to achieve the goal. 

Finally, author discussed “transhumanism” which intend to use technology to transform humanity in a progress “not merely what will happen, but what should happen” and described it as the “natural extension of lightenment thoughts”

### Side read
Paper: *Humans can consciously generate random number sequences: A possible test for artificial intelligence*

The studies in this work shows that humans can generate truely randomly distributed numbers, without any pattern, effortlessly. One might then ask if this ability is uniquely human. If artifical neural networks are accurate models of human brain, they should also be able to generate random numbers. 

Author also purposed that when we make discussioins where the outcomes are similar, the random generation mechanism may be effective, implying the randomness in our decisions.
