##### Introduction
This essay is introduced by Connectome, Sebastian Seung. Apparently, there is also a movie called the world, the flesh and the devil, which seems to have a different theme [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053454/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053454/)

Ending remarks in the last chapter:
>We are on the point of being able to see the effects of our actions and their probable consequences in the future; we hold the future still timidly, but perceive it for the first time, as a function of our own action. Having seen it, are we to turn away from something that offends the very nature of our earliest desires, or is the recognition of our new powers sufficient to change those desires into the service of the future which they will have to bring about?

### The World, The Flesh and The Devil
1929 
##### Part 1. The Future
There are two types of future, the *future of desire* and the *future of fate* and it is difficult to separate them. Scientific methods demand that we put aside our desire of the future. Is it possible for us to examine the future scientifically? Since future is not object to observation nor experimation, we can only make prediction.

It is necessary to exclude the illustion of the future as a fulfillment of the present. For near future it is most likely that we are influenced by our desire, while for more distant future we are less constrained by our desire, but it is difficult to divest ourselves of the customary forms of the present. 

There are *three source of thoughts* to help us describe the future: history, physical science and the knowledge of our desires. The difficulty of the prediction is the complexity and the interdependence of all its parts. But: 1) future consists of complexes that form a hierarchy and each of the complex follow its own rules, and 2) We can always ignore the higher complexes when we consider the lower.

The advances in knowledge is the continuation of the present knowledge and it form the minimal basis for prediction and it is impossible to go beyond to include imaginary discoveries. It is also possible that some unforseen discoveries is so important that it change the course of development, but we should not be bothered by it. The unpredicable rate of development in different fields, which constantly reacting on each other, makes the prediction much more difficult, and we should separate the variables as best we can and make prediction in one field at a time and combining the results. 

The author stated that three fields are worth our attention
1. Our struggle with the massive, unintelligent forces of nature,
2. Our relationship with animals, plants and our body,
3. Our struggle with desires, fears, imaginations and stupidities.

##### Part 2. The World
Here author tried to make prediction for the development of the material world. 

First of all, quantum theory will give us the ability to change the nature of matter and let us produce new materials. Our need for food, and clothing can be satisfied by biochemical and chemical methods. Men is to conquer space as they conquer the air, the ability to leave earth give us the ability to explore our solar system, we will likely to inhabit space colonies in the form of self-supplying space station where men no longer need the diversity of earth life, animals and plants to satisfy their interest (Bernal sphere). 

Finally, men will not ultimately be content to be parasitic on stars but also to invade them and organize them for his own purpose, by doing so prolonging the life of the universe itself, compared to that without organization.

##### Part 3. The Flesh
The author suggested here that we will begin the modification of our body. The biology mechanism of human body is inefficient to keep human mind working. *In a civilized worker the limbs are mere parasites*. After the death of our body, people will decide whether to abandon his body or his life, and since it is the only the brain that counts, we will live on with artifical body since it will become possible to attach nerves to the brain that enable the mind to continue function. 

At young age, man can occupy his time in natural life, but later he will leave his body and start to fully explore his potential with new possibilities provided by technology and “emerge as a completely effective, mentally-directed mechanism and set about the tasks appropriate to his new capacities. This new man will appear to be strange, monstrous and inhuman, but he is the only logical outcome of the type of humanity that exists at present. “Normal man is an evolutionary dead end, mechanical man is actually more in the true tradition of further evolution”. 

A further possibility is for minds to connect to each other (*complex mind*), freely transfer memory and feeling, while still function independently with different tasks and purpose. By doing so, when the old mind die, they will transfer their memory and knowledge to others without losing the continuity of the self. *By this way, death itself can be avoided*.

Eventually, with more materials that are available to man, they will come to substitute more and more the inferior functions of the brain such as memory and reflex action, “bit by bit the heritage of the direct line of mankind, the heritage of the original life emerging on the face of the world, will dwindle and new life will take its place and continue its development”. and It is possible that the consciousness itself may end or vanish in a humanity that has become completely etherealized.

##### Part 4. The Devil
The devil is our capacities, our desires and our inner confusions that we at present are difficult to understand. However, the *progress of the future depend critically on our reaction of the material universe and will be hindered or stopped either by* 1) the failure in the capacity for maintaining creative intellectual thinking or 2) by the lack of desire to apply such thinking to the progress of humanity.

For the first point, *one of the most threatening retarding factors of the present is specialization as the specialist is ignorant of current thought in other field*. The remedy is an intelligently operated system of distribution and grading of knowledge so that each worker will have the needed information outside his speciality and communication will play an important role. It is also important that scientific community should transform from a “food gathering” to a “food producing” society. The *industrization of science* require planned and directed research that employ hunderds of workers for many years, without risking the loss of independence and originality. 

For the second point, the author observed that there are two type of psychological determinants in any culture, a small group that capable of more than average performance and a mass of people effective not so much by their number but hold on traditions. There is a process of selecting which is the currently dominant type. It is after all the desire of an age or an individual, rather than intellectual power, that will determine whether or not human being will develop further, and if our desire is only found in eating, drinking and dancing, then “the golden age may settle permanently on the world”, but if we find our desire on the paths of intellectual or aesthetic creation, than “we may find a capacity to live at the same time more fully human and fully intellectual lives”.

The desire can also not be made effective if it cannot overcome the real distaste and hatred which mechanization has already brought into being and the more rapid change in the environment, the less our mind is able to adapt itself to those changes and the more violent will be its emotional reactions. There will be a conflict between the general public and the people involved in bringing the technology about. 

##### Part 5. The Synthesis
The world and the flesh are closely connected, the mechanized man will have an advantage in space, and only in space can the potential of highly developed forms acquire new knowledge. 

However, “as the scene of life would be more the cold emptiness of space than the warm, dense atmosphere of planets”, the importance of our mind andpsychology will start to play an more important role. when we discard the form of our body, our physical instincts will be changed into something else. “As time goes on, the acceptance, appreciation even the understanding of nature will be less and less needed and in its place will come the need to determine the desirable form of the university which is nothing more nor less than art”. 

##### Part 6. Possibility
*The current human societies can be essentially qualified as “co-operative body-satisfying societies”. When the problem of production and distribution of products satisfying our needs are solved, what is to become of humanity?* The author suggested that we may come to “live to think” instead of “thinking to live”, in analogy of a transformation from “eat to live” to “live to eat”. But if man is to develop something new, the question would be if all humanity is going to develop or only a part of it? 

In history many classes has rise to a point where there seemed a permanent gulf between it and the others. But the gulf is not permanent because they are only superfically different from others and they do not progress themselves in such a way to increase their distance with the rest. *But in the near future, scientist could take the role and split off from the other citizens*. The separation of scientists from the rest of the society would save the struggle and difficulty which would be ensue if there were any attempt to change the whole bulk of population and remove the obstacles that may counter the above development.

The counter force to this, would be the fact that more and more people would need to be involved in the scientific activities so that scientists themselves cannot form a closed states, and the fact that “scientist, in every respect, save their work, resemble their non-scientific brothers” and are ultimately bind to humanity as a whole. 

But eventually, scientist are not masters of the destiny of science and the changes they bring about, may force them into positions which they would never have been chosen.
