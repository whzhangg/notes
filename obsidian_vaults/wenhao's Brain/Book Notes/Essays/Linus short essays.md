##### Intellectual property
The fundamental problem of IP protection is that it protect the owner of the IP, not the comsumer or user of that IP. Furthermore, the copyrighit holder also have the right to sue people who sell properties that looks like his or hers, where the distinction between inspiration and copying is not clear. Therefore, other creative people are not protected by the notion of IP. 

Copy holders should have the right over their IPs, but *with rights come obligations*. They should have the obligations to use these rights in responsible ways, not as a weapon against others who lack such rights. The notion of a *fair use* should exist.

But IPs are also important in that it generates a *powerful, positive feedback* cycle, and a lot of money and investment are being spend on creating more intellectual properties. The question is, what kind of IP law would help drive development while being less driven by money-grabbing interests? 

It's difficult to propose an alternative, but it is important to recognize the mis-use of the intellectual property law, when the IP laws are being used not to help foster innovation, but to control the marketplace, to control what consumers can and cannot do. 

##### An End to control
>The way to survive and flourish is to make the best damn product. You can. And if you can't survive and flourish on that, then you shouldn't.  
>It's not about trying to control people

If you try to success is by trying to control, as circumstances change your hold gets broken and you're left with nothing. A company that excert less control is a company that isn't blinded by greed or by fear of competition. It's a sign of a company that *believes in itself, and doesn't have time to hate*.

##### Linus' meaning of life:
Linus wrote three things that make us do the things we do: *Survival*, *your place in the social order*, and *entertainment*.
> Survive, socialize and have fun. That's the progression.
