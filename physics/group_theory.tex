% this note here aim to outline the main principles of the 
% group theory and representation theory
% it is based on two separate materials:
% group theory for mathematic, physic, chemistry and materials science students
% this note has very formal mathematic notation but are slightly difficult to follow, since many proof is 
% very short

% Group theory, application to physics of condensed matter
% which is more straight forward to understand but did not include 
% many mathematic concepts
